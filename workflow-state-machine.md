Here’s a refined prompt you can use to get focused, engineer-level answers about building an LLM agent orchestration backend:

Prompt:

> You are a senior software engineer expert in building backend orchestration systems for LLM agents and workflows.

I want to design a backend execution engine for agent workflows represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Each node is an LLM or tool call, possibly long-running and streaming output. The engine must execute nodes respecting dependencies, maintain runtime state (idle, running, success, error), and support streaming partial outputs to clients in real time.

Describe, in detail and with example data structures and pseudocode, how you would build such an engine:

Representing the graph and execution state

Scheduling and running nodes in topological order

Supporting extensible “node runners” (LLM calls, HTTP calls, etc.)

Streaming token-level outputs asynchronously

Emitting runtime events for client consumption


Focus on backend design, orchestration patterns, and runtime models.
Write clearly and use technical language.




---

If you want, I can help you craft a version tuned for other parts (e.g., frontend integration, retry policies, etc.) too.



Here’s a detailed prompt you can use with any LLM to scaffold your resilient, extensible, resumable workflow engine.

You can copy-paste this directly into a codegen LLM, or use it in a repo README/spec file to onboard contributors.

✅ Prompt: Build a Resilient Workflow Orchestrator in TypeScript

Goal

Create a resilient, inspectable, and extensible workflow engine in TypeScript, running as a Node.js CLI tool. It should use XState to model each workflow as a state machine. The engine must support long-running computations, failure recovery, workflow persistence, parallelization using workers, and developer-friendly CLI ergonomics.


---

🧱 Project Overview

Project name: statepipe
Type: Node.js CLI Framework
Language: TypeScript
Core libraries:

xstate: for state machine modeling

chalk, ora: for colorful logging and spinners

cli-progress: for progress bar rendering

piscina: to run workflows in Node.js worker threads

pg or @supabase/postgrest-js: for Postgres persistence

commander or yargs: for CLI interface

fs, stream, readline: for streaming partial output



---

🎯 Functional Requirements

1. Workflow as State Machine

Each workflow is modeled as a self-contained XState machine.

It should support:

Context (input, progress, intermediate values)

Transitions for init, running, success, error, cancelled

Metadata for logging/progress (label, type, tags)



2. CLI Runner

The CLI should support commands like:

statepipe run <workflow>
statepipe resume <workflow-id>
statepipe inspect <workflow-id>

Support flags:

--dry-run: simulate execution

--verbose: enable detailed logging

--inspect: print live workflow state

--concurrency=N: for batch/parallel runs



3. Hooks API

Allow users to define lifecycle hooks:

onInit, onProgress, onSuccess, onError, onRetry, onComplete


Hooks should receive context and workflow metadata.

Optional plugin/hook registration system.


4. Persistence

Store each workflow execution in a DB (PostgreSQL preferred).

Required fields:

id, type, input, state, result, status, updated_at


Use XState’s state.toJSON() and State.create() for serialization.

Ability to resume execution from DB snapshot.


5. Error Recovery

Retry failed workflows with exponential or linear backoff.

Define per-op retry policy: maxAttempts, backoffMs, strategy

Track retry count in persisted state.


6. Parallelism and Batch Execution

Allow multiple workflows to run concurrently.

Use Piscina or node:worker_threads to run heavy jobs in separate threads.

Limit concurrency via config.


7. Progress and Output

Use cli-progress to track parallel/batch progress.

Allow streamed JSONL output:

output/results.jsonl with one JSON per line (partial or full result)


Option to log to stdout or file with chalk formatting.

📦 Example: Workflow Definition

export const monteCarloMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'montecarlo',
  initial: 'init',
  context: { seed: 0, result: null },
  states: {
    init: {
      entry: 'logInit',
      always: 'computing',
    },
    computing: {
      invoke: {
        src: 'computeSim',
        onDone: { target: 'success', actions: 'storeResult' },
        onError: { target: 'error' },
      },
    },
    success: { type: 'final' },
    error: { type: 'final' },
  },
});


---

🔄 Resume Workflow

await resumeWorkflow('workflow-id-123', monteCarloMachine);
// Rehydrates from DB and restarts interpreter


---

💡 Optional Enhancements

Redis pub/sub for remote workflow coordination

Supabase client for cloud DB + auth

JSON schema validation for workflow inputs

Remote API to start/inspect workflows (via Fastify)

UI dashboard (later)



---

🔚 Deliverables

CLI entrypoint (bin/statepipe)

Sample workflow definition

Configurable retry/backoff/resume behavior

Worker support via Piscina

Output streaming and file logging

Persistent DB for stateful resumability

Basic tests for lifecycle and restart



---

Let me know if you need the LLM to:

Generate the full scaffolded repo

Focus on a particular layer (e.g., worker pool, DB persistence)

Provide typed helper functions for hooks or state ops


You’re good to go. Want me to generate the full repo layout for this now?
