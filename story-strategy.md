🧵 Parallel Releases Are Killing Our Velocity

❓ What's happening

We often plan and develop for multiple releases in parallel:

Stories for June and July are being estimated, groomed, and developed at the same time.

Some devs hold back merges to avoid polluting the “next release”.

We sometimes “freeze main” or create long-lived feature/release branches.

CI builds, testing, and deployments become gated by RFC dates or staging environments.

Stories are technically “done” but unreleasable.



---

🧨 Why this is a problem

This setup causes:

🔥 Symptom	⚠️ Impact

Long-lived branches	Merge conflicts, stale context
“Done” ≠ Releasable	Work sits idle, delivery is delayed
Parallel QA surfaces	Repeated testing, inconsistent validation
Context switching	Dev burnout, lost focus
Complex coordination	Higher overhead for PMs, QA, and release managers



---

✅ A Better Model

Let’s simplify. One active release at a time:

🔁 Proposed Flow

1. All work goes into `main` (always mergeable)
2. Use feature flags if a story can't ship this release
3. Cut `release/x` branches from `main` when ready to QA
4. Ship. Cherry-pick hotfixes if needed.
5. Rinse, repeat.

🧰 Tools That Make It Work

Feature Flags: LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or simple DB/config switches

Runtime toggles: Use per-environment config or role-based gates

CI automation: Auto-tag releases, keep main green

Hotfix strategy: Patch from main, cherry-pick into release if needed



---

🎯 Benefits

Before	After

2+ releases in parallel	1 focused release stream
Stale work waiting for RFC window	Continuous merge & deploy
QA juggling branches	Clear, stable test surfaces
Complex Git gymnastics	Simple and clean branching
Devs waiting to merge	Fast feedback, fast value



---

💬 Closing Thought

> More parallel work ≠ more output
It means more WIP, more risk, and slower value delivery



If a future story must start early:

Merge behind a flag

Avoid parallel planning ceremonies

Keep team focus where it delivers value now



---

📣 Let's discuss

Are there real constraints blocking this?

Can we prototype it on one pod or project?

What would we need to enable cleaner release flow?

Let me know if you want this as a Confluence template or want it integrated with a diagram flow (e.g. Miro, Excalidraw).
