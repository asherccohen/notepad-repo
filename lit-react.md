Prompt:

I have a Lit web component library using TypeScript 5.8.3 and the new ECMAScript decorators standard. I want to consume this library in a React app locally (importing as a TS module) and remotely (compiled JS module). I‚Äôm using Webpack and Babel in my build pipeline.

Problem:

When importing the TS source locally, I get errors about "properties will not trigger updates as expected."

When importing compiled JS remotely, it works fine.

Both the app and the library have aligned tsconfig.json settings with:

{
  "experimentalDecorators": true,
  "useDefineForClassFields": false,
  "emitDecoratorMetadata": false,
  "target": "ES2022",
  "module": "ESNext"
}

I suspect the issue might be related to Babel or the decorator handling in the build.


Questions:

1. Is Lit compatible with the new decorators syntax from TypeScript 5+?


2. How do I configure TypeScript and Webpack (ts-loader) to work with the new decorators?


3. Could Babel be causing the issue, and how should Babel be configured to support the new decorators standard with TypeScript 5+?


4. Why does importing the TS source locally cause issues, but importing the compiled JS remotely does not?


5. How do I align all these configurations (TypeScript, Babel, Webpack, Lit) so that reactive properties update correctly without errors?



Context:

Lit 3+ supports the new decorators syntax and recommends importing decorators from 'lit/decorators.js'.

Babel‚Äôs @babel/preset-typescript does not transform decorators, so @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators with "version": "2023-01" must be added.

TypeScript 5‚Äôs new decorators are incompatible with emitDecoratorMetadata and require useDefineForClassFields to be false to match Lit's reactive properties system.

Babel plugin order matters; decorators plugin must come before class properties plugins.


Please provide a detailed explanation of the compatibility issues, necessary build config changes, and the root cause of the problem with TS source imports versus compiled JS imports in this context.

Sure! Here‚Äôs a concise prompt you can feed to an LLM to get a thorough, accurate answer about your setup:

Prompt:

I am building a Lit web component that internally renders React components. I want to manage styles as follows:

Use Rollup with rollup-plugin-postcss to process all CSS imports (including third-party library CSS), excluding any Lit `css`` tagged literals.

Extract all these styles into a single physical bundle.css file.

In my Lit component, I want to import this bundle.css file directly and assign it to static styles for Shadow DOM styling, e.g.:

import styles from './bundle.css';

static styles = [styles];

I do not want to fetch the CSS at runtime.

I do not use Lit's CSS tagged template literals (`css``).

I want to know:

1. How to configure Rollup and PostCSS to produce a bundled CSS file from imports only.


2. Whether it‚Äôs possible to import that bundled CSS as a usable style object in Lit without fetching.


3. If not, what tooling or plugin can enable importing a CSS file as a CSSStyleSheet suitable for static styles.


4. Recommendations for best practice integrating React components inside a Lit Shadow DOM with shared styling.

This prompt captures your context and exact questions, and will get you a clear, actionable answer.



Got it ‚Äî if you're disabling Shadow DOM (i.e., rendering into light DOM), that changes a few things but also simplifies some others ‚Äî especially around styling and integration with global CSS.

Here‚Äôs how to adapt your Lit + React setup accordingly.


---

‚úÖ Disable Shadow DOM in Lit

You need to override the createRenderRoot() method in your Lit component:

createRenderRoot() {
  return this; // disables Shadow DOM, uses light DOM instead
}

This makes Lit render into the element's own light DOM, so this.querySelector() and global styles work as expected.


---

üîÑ Updated Full Example (with createRoot and light DOM)

import { LitElement, html } from 'lit'
import { customElement, property } from 'lit/decorators.js'
import { createRoot, Root } from 'react-dom/client'
import React from 'react'
import MyReactComponent from './MyReactComponent'

@customElement('my-lit-component')
export class MyLitComponent extends LitElement {
  @property({ type: String }) message = ''

  private reactRoot?: Root
  private container?: HTMLDivElement

  // üëá Disable Shadow DOM
  createRenderRoot() {
    return this
  }

  firstUpdated() {
    this.container = this.querySelector('#react-root') as HTMLDivElement

    if (this.container) {
      this.reactRoot = createRoot(this.container)
      this.renderReact()
    }
  }

  updated(changedProps: Map<string, unknown>) {
    if (changedProps.has('message')) {
      this.renderReact()
    }
  }

  private renderReact() {
    if (this.reactRoot) {
      this.reactRoot.render(<MyReactComponent message={this.message} />)
    }
  }

  disconnectedCallback() {
    this.reactRoot?.unmount()
    super.disconnectedCallback()
  }

  render() {
    return html`<div id="react-root"></div>`
  }
}


---

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes for Light DOM:

Use this.querySelector() instead of this.shadowRoot?.querySelector().

Global styles and :host selectors won't behave like in Shadow DOM ‚Äî use normal classes and cascading CSS.

If you're injecting React components that expect isolated styling, be aware that light DOM makes them subject to the page's global styles ‚Äî you might want to scope them manually or use CSS Modules in React.



---

Let me know if your use case also needs:

multiple React mount points

slotting data from Lit into React

rehydration or SSR considerations


I can give you precise patterns for those.



Yes, 100%. You can absolutely create a base class template for a Lit web component that handles the React mounting logic (createRoot, renderReact, etc.), and then extend it for more specific components with additional reactive properties or custom behavior.

This is a great pattern for reusability, especially when you're embedding React into many Lit-based components.


---

‚úÖ Base Class Template

// base-react-lit.ts
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit'
import { Root, createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import React from 'react'

export abstract class BaseReactLit<P = {}> extends LitElement {
  protected reactRoot?: Root
  protected container?: HTMLElement

  // Light DOM, so styles can bleed in
  createRenderRoot() {
    return this
  }

  firstUpdated() {
    this.container = this.querySelector('#react-root') as HTMLElement

    if (this.container) {
      this.reactRoot = createRoot(this.container)
      this.renderReact()
    }
  }

  updated() {
    this.renderReact()
  }

  disconnectedCallback() {
    this.reactRoot?.unmount()
    super.disconnectedCallback()
  }

  /**
   * Implement this in child classes to render the correct React tree
   */
  protected abstract getReactComponent(): React.ReactElement<P>

  protected renderReact() {
    if (this.reactRoot && this.container) {
      this.reactRoot.render(this.getReactComponent())
    }
  }

  render() {
    return html`<div id="react-root"></div>`
  }
}


---

üöÄ Extend with Specific Components

// my-lit-wrapper.ts
import { customElement, property } from 'lit/decorators.js'
import React from 'react'
import MyReactComponent from './MyReactComponent'
import { BaseReactLit } from './base-react-lit'

@customElement('my-lit-wrapper')
export class MyLitWrapper extends BaseReactLit<{ message: string }> {
  @property({ type: String }) message = 'default message'

  protected getReactComponent() {
    return <MyReactComponent message={this.message} />
  }
}


---

‚úÖ Benefits

You centralize lifecycle and interop logic.

You can override render() if you want to place <slot>s or other markup outside the React root.

You can add custom scheduling, throttling, memoization, or batching in renderReact in the base class.



---

üß† Optional Enhancements

Add a shouldRenderReact(changedProps) hook.

Add lifecycle hooks like beforeReactRender() / afterReactRender().

Add a way to pass children via slot and inject them into the React tree.


Let me know if you want a version that supports passing slotted DOM nodes as children into the React component ‚Äî it's a bit more work but possible.
