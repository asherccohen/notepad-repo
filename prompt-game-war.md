Hereâ€™s a prompt you can use with an LLM to get a high-quality answer based on our conversation and your project goals:

ðŸ§  Prompt for LLM:

> I'm building a text-based tactical wargame (TTW) called WAR TACTICS, where players issue commands like:
"Move Alpha to Ridge-3 before dawn under radio silence"
The game has no visualsâ€”only text commands and outputs. Orders are parsed into structured directives, and the game world progresses in tick-based steps (e.g., 5â€“15 min per tick). Units have traits like morale, supplies, fatigue, initiative. The world is composed of abstract zones (e.g., Ridge, Bridgepoint), and includes fog of war, signal jamming, and autonomous behavior.

Before introducing LLMs, I want to implement the game logic that handles how the system reacts after a command is issued, and how the game world reacts independently (e.g., morale loss, AI movement, weather).

Specifically:

How can I structure the game tick logic to handle both:

Player-issued commands

Autonomous world or unit behavior (environment, AI, state-based reactions)


What are the systems or modules I should implement first to handle:

Command resolution

Combat triggers

Morale/fatigue checks

Enemy strategy

World state changes like weather or jamming


What are good data structures and tick-based flows to simulate these systems deterministically?


Please respond with an overview of how the game engine should handle:

1. Command parsing and queuing


2. Tick-based simulation loop


3. Emergent behaviors triggered by internal state


4. Environmental events and enemy logic



Keep it deterministic and modularâ€”LLMs will only be used later for natural language parsing and report generation.

Let me know if you want to expand this to include architecture hints (e.g., ECS with miniplex, XState flows, or React-based debug tooling).
