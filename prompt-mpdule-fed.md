Sure! Here's a clear prompt you can use for an LLM to get the full picture about React version mismatches in Module Federation, based on our conversation:


---

Prompt:

> In a Webpack Module Federation setup, what happens if a federated remote module uses a different React version than the host/consumer app?
Please explain:

The default behavior when React is shared as a singleton with version requirements.

What happens if React versions differ but React is forced to be a singleton.

What happens if React is not shared (singleton: false) and each side bundles its own React version.

The pros and cons of allowing independent React versions per remote/host.

The architectural trade-offs and limitations when decoupling React versions in federated apps.

Best practices and recommendations for sharing or splitting React versions in microfrontend architectures.

How this affects context, hooks, bundle size, and runtime behavior.

When to choose each approach depending on your goals (shared app vs fully isolated microfrontends).


Provide concrete examples of Webpack shared config for each case, and practical advice on handling version mismatches.

Would you like me to generate a more concise or more technical version of this prompt?
