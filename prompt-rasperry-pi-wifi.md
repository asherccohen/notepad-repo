Yes, you can absolutely set up a Raspberry Pi to act as a Wi-Fi access point with WPA2 security, while being connected to your network/router via Ethernet. This is a common use case for turning a Raspberry Pi into a Wi-Fi repeater, IoT gateway, or local network access point.

✅ What you want:

Raspberry Pi is wired via Ethernet to your main router (LAN/internet).

Raspberry Pi broadcasts a Wi-Fi access point.

That AP uses WPA2 (not WPA3).

Devices can connect to the Pi's Wi-Fi and route traffic through the Ethernet.



---

✅ Requirements

Raspberry Pi with built-in Wi-Fi (e.g., Pi 3/4/5 or Zero W)

Raspberry Pi OS (preferably Lite or Minimal for performance)

A wired Ethernet connection (static or DHCP)

Packages: hostapd, dnsmasq, and optional iptables or nftables



---

✅ Setup Overview

1. Update & install required packages

sudo apt update
sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq


2. Configure a static IP on the Pi's Wi-Fi interface Add to /etc/dhcpcd.conf:

interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.4.1/24
nohook wpa_supplicant


3. Configure hostapd – WPA2 only, no WPA3 File: /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=YourNetworkName
hw_mode=g
channel=7
wmm_enabled=1
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=YourStrongPassword
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP

Then link config:

sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
# Add or edit:
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"


4. Configure dnsmasq – lightweight DHCP/DNS Backup the original first:

sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig

Create new /etc/dnsmasq.conf:

interface=wlan0
dhcp-range=192.168.4.10,192.168.4.100,255.255.255.0,24h


5. Enable IP forwarding & NAT Edit /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Apply immediately:

sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"

Set up NAT with iptables:

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT

Save the iptables rules:

sudo apt install iptables-persistent
sudo netfilter-persistent save


6. Enable and start services

sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq
sudo systemctl start hostapd
sudo systemctl start dnsmasq




---

✅ Done

You now have:

A Wi-Fi AP running on wlan0 with WPA2 encryption.

Clients connecting via Wi-Fi get IPs in 192.168.4.x.

Traffic is routed through eth0 to the internet.



---

🔐 Notes

This setup does not use WPA3. wpa=2 ensures WPA2-PSK.

This is a standalone access point, not a bridge. If you need bridging instead of NAT (for all clients to be on the same LAN as Ethernet), you'll need to use bridge-utils and disable dnsmasq NAT.

Want a script or playbook to automate this?

Sure. Here's your original question and context summarized as a prompt suitable for an LLM to generate a helpful answer:

🧠 LLM Prompt:

> Prompt:

I'm setting up a Raspberry Pi as a Wi-Fi access point.
I want the Pi to:

Be connected to my main router via Ethernet (eth0)

Broadcast a Wi-Fi access point using its built-in wireless (wlan0)

Use WPA2 (not WPA3) security for the access point

Allow devices that connect to the Pi’s Wi-Fi to access the internet via the Ethernet connection


What packages do I need?
How should I configure the network interfaces, hostapd, and dnsmasq?
How do I enable NAT and IP forwarding to share the internet connection from Ethernet to Wi-Fi?
Also, how do I ensure the access point uses WPA2 only?

Let me know if you want a version tailored for automation (e.g., Ansible playbook or bash script generation).
