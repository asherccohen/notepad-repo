### Baseline Lore for a Sci-Fi War Tactics Strategy Game Story Mode

#### Core Setting:

Centuries ago, humanity launched a fleet of **generation starships** destined for a cluster of habitable exoplanets across a resource-rich nebula. These ships—massive, self-sustaining vessels—each carried cultural seeds from old Earth, equipped with **hibernation pods, hydroponic jungles, ancient AI libraries**, and primitive armed units designed for hostile planetary survey and defense.

During the journey, **communications fractured**. A few ships arrived first, established colonies, and evolved rapidly, developing distinct societies with diverse ideologies. Later-arriving ships—slower or set adrift through mishap—are just now arriving to discover these worlds claimed or contested. Others, their internal cultures eroded by generations of isolation, drift in orbit, their crew amnesiac, myth-laden, or even mutated.

#### Major Factions and Personas:
- **Grimstone’s Wardens** (inspired by "Voyage That Lasted 600 Years"):
  - Guardians of ancient purpose, periodically revived, remembering original Earth’s mission. They seek to reunite or dominate the fleet and colonies, fearful of lost heritage.

- **The Somnolents** (from "Twilight"):
  - Post-human colonists who rely on autonomous machines for everything. Emotionally dulled but technologically potent, they see war as illogical, but will defend with overpowering drones.

- **Tribal Freegrowers** (from "Non-Stop"):
  - Descendants of starship dwellers who regressed into feral societies amid shipboard jungles. They excel in guerrilla tactics and shipboard infiltration, wielding weaponized tools made from old tech.

- **The Transcendence Circle** (from "World, Flesh & Devil"):
  - Visionary outcasts—bioengineers, philosophers, hackers—seeking to evolve humanity further. They employ biotech units and mind-altering tactics, and manipulate psychological warfare.

- **Tani’s Pathfinders** (from "Tani of Ekkis"):
  - Adaptive colonists, newly landed, uncertain of their purpose. They balance preservation of tradition with forging a new identity; choices in battle and diplomacy shape the future of their people.

#### Timelines & Campaign Structure:

- **Prologue (Shipboard)**: 
  - Centuries in transit—learned via flashbacks as players explore ship ruins, recover lost tactical archives, and encounter survivor factions with distorted cultural memories.
- **Conflict Phase**:
  - Arrival on contested planets and asteroids. Older, established colonies face the sudden arrival of "sibling" ships. Tensions erupt into war, alliances, and sabotage.
- **Unification/Mythic Endgame**:
  - Lore converges—revelations about Earth’s fate emerge; victory conditions may trigger a transformation (post-human ascendence, united star network, or legacy extinction).

#### Key Gameplay Lore Elements:

- **Command Interface**: Players issue tactical orders via command-line, relaying through AI or direct unit neural-links.
- **Environments**: Battles unfold on overgrown starships, ruined colony domes, terraformed planets, and asteroid outposts, each with environmental hazards (e.g., hull breaches, bioengineered fauna).
- **Unit Types**:
  - **Wardens**: Elite cyborgs, hibernation reawakened.
  - **Drones**: Emotionless, mathematically optimized swarm units.
  - **Tribalists**: Stealth scouts and close-range berserkers.
  - **Bioengineers**: Units that heal, mutate, or mind-hack others.
  - **Pathfinders**: Versatile, morale-driven squads with adaptive special abilities.
- **Equipment/Tech**: 
  - Hibernation pods, “ponics” ecosystem, AI archives, ancient energy weapons, gene-editing devices, psychological warfare tools.

#### Narrative Themes:

- **The Burden of Memory and Purpose**: Units and leaders struggle against loss of mission and mythic distortion.
- **Cultural Conflict and Adaptation**: Encounters between the tradition-bound and the innovator; preservation vs. progress.
- **Psychological and Biological Evolution**: Both as battlefield weapons and deeper philosophical conflict.
- **Futility vs. Hope**: Does progress bring unity, extinction, or transformation?

#### Emotional/Best Story Moments:

- Discovering a derelict sister ship haunted by generational amnesia, then reviving lost units for an assault or alliance.
- Negotiating or fighting with post-human drones that speak in cryptic, melancholic mathematical riddles.
- Mid-battle revelations that change objectives—such as reliving the original Earth’s mission in a final echo.
- The bittersweet merging (or destruction) of two cultures: the player must choose what fragments of memory, tradition, or innovation survive in the emerging civilization.

**This baseline lore blends generational isolation, forgotten missions, posthuman malaise, tribal regression, and psychological transcendence, forming a richly textured setting for command-driven tactical sci-fi conflict across ships, planets, and the edge of human destiny.**


# Product Requirements Document (PRD):  
## Sci-Fi War Tactics Strategy Game – Narrative Story Mode

## 1. **Overview**

This document outlines the core narrative, setting, game moments, and progression chapters for the story campaign of a sci-fi tactics game inspired by the innovative generation-ship and posthumanism themes synthesized from several classic and obscure sci-fi works. The game features a command-line interface for issuing tactical unit commands in turn-based missions spanning derelict starships, new-world colonies, and enigmatic asteroid strongholds.

## 2. **Core Story & Atmosphere**

### A. **Setting**

**Centuries after the Departure:** Humanity’s last hope for survival was a diaspora: a fleet of massive generation ships launched toward a nebula of habitable worlds. Over centuries, these ships and their people changed:
- Some arrived first, established societies, and evolved—via technology, biogenetics, or social philosophy (echoes of Bernal, Campbell).
- Straggler ships became playgrounds for myth, tribalization, and biological mutation (as in Aldiss, Reeves).
- Disconnected, each group developed its own vision for humanity’s future—ready to clash when paths cross on newly claimed worlds.

**Playable Environments:**
- Ruined starships, filled with wild hydroponics, tribal societies, dormant AI, and forgotten tech.
- Terraformed planets featuring ruined domes, overgrown cities, and posthuman settlements.
- Hollowed asteroids and orbital stations—frontiers of resource contention.

## 5. **Key Narrative Themes, Tools, and Mechanics Integration**

- **Cultural Drift vs. Recovery:** In gameplay, units lose or gain attributes based on evolving command structure, morale, and recovered lore.
- **AI, Mutation, and Memory as Resources:** Ancient labs, gene-editors, and archives must be captured/secured, with risks (e.g., mutations, AI escapes).

- **Replayable Multichapter Campaign:** Decisions in each chapter change world-state, available units, and outcomes in future operations.

## 6. **Feature-Driven Requirements**

- Story chapters must be fully playable stand-alone and as part of the campaign, supporting both narrative and strategy-first players.

- Multiple endings reflecting diverse player values: restoration, adaptation, extinction, transcendence.
- All units and hero types tied to backstory factions; unique special abilities unlocked by story events.

## 7. **Emotional & Player Experience Goals**

- **Awe & Mystery:** Environment and log descriptions must evoke vast time, loss, and the strangeness of reclaimed technology.
- **Tension & Agency:** Dramatic stakes and choices—can you save a lost generation or will you sacrifice the past for survival?
- **Discovery & Reflection:** Piecing together the real mission/history is a meta-puzzle affecting gameplay and narrative.

### This PRD establishes an atmospheric, flexible, and deeply narrative-driven experience that combines grand-scale lore with tactical gameplay, where every choice in command and story shapes the fate of scattered humanity.
