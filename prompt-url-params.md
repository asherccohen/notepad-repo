Here’s your conversation distilled into a clean LLM prompt that captures all the details you asked for:


---

Prompt:

> I want to make URL search parameters shorter by encoding and compressing them, then decoding and decompressing them on page load.
I’m using TypeScript, Next.js/Remix, and nuqs for query state management.

Please:

1. Recommend npm libraries for compression + encoding that work in the browser.


2. Explain if they produce URI-safe strings suitable for search params.


3. Compare their pros/cons, size, and speed.


4. Show how to integrate one of them (preferably lz-string, pako, or lzma) with nuqs custom serialize/deserialize options.


5. Include TypeScript code examples for both compression/encoding and integration with nuqs.


6. Mention any caveats for URL length limits or browser compatibility.

Do you want me to now rewrite your original question using this prompt so you can directly feed it to another LLM? That would make it copy-paste ready.
