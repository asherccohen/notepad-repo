Prompt for LLM:

> I’m exploring the housing market in Menorca (Spain), Corfu and Zakynthos (Greece). I want to buy a house that’s not in a hyper-touristic or luxury area—no overpriced villas aimed at the wealthy. Focus on local-level affordability, realistic prices for long-term living, and areas with actual local communities, not just seasonal tourism.

Help me with:

1. Current price ranges for houses (not apartments), ideally detached, in small towns or inland areas of each island.


2. Average price per square meter in those non-premium areas.


3. Areas/neighborhoods or villages on each island that are:

Under the radar (not party hubs)

Safe and connected (road/internet)

Still affordable for working/middle-class people



4. Legal requirements and restrictions for foreign buyers in Spain and Greece (briefly).


5. Anything to watch out for (ownership complexities, local bureaucracy, real estate pitfalls).


6. Local property platforms or agencies with reliable listings for those areas.





Avoid listings or advice skewed toward luxury investors or expat-retirement resorts.
