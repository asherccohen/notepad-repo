Prompt for LLM:

> I’m exploring the housing market in Menorca (Spain), Corfu and Zakynthos (Greece). I want to buy a house that’s not in a hyper-touristic or luxury area—no overpriced villas aimed at the wealthy. Focus on local-level affordability, realistic prices for long-term living, and areas with actual local communities, not just seasonal tourism.

Help me with:

1. Current price ranges for houses (not apartments), ideally detached, in small towns or inland areas of each island.


2. Average price per square meter in those non-premium areas.


3. Areas/neighborhoods or villages on each island that are:

Under the radar (not party hubs)

Safe and connected (road/internet)

Still affordable for working/middle-class people



4. Legal requirements and restrictions for foreign buyers in Spain and Greece (briefly).


5. Anything to watch out for (ownership complexities, local bureaucracy, real estate pitfalls).


6. Local property platforms or agencies with reliable listings for those areas.





Avoid listings or advice skewed toward luxury investors or expat-retirement resorts.

> I’m evaluating real estate in Menorca (Balearic Islands), Corfu, and Zakynthos (Greece). I want to find houses (preferably detached) for long-term living—not luxury villas or hyper-touristy investments. Focus on realistic, accessible prices for working/middle-class buyers.

Questions to answer:

1. What are current price ranges (€ or €/m²) for detached houses in non-premium, inland or small-town areas on each island?


2. What villages or neighborhoods offer affordability, local communities, infrastructure (roads, internet), and aren’t overrun with tourists or wealthy buyers?


3. Renovation context: average renovation costs per m², typical pitfalls, timeframes; builder availability and challenges.


4. Legal/buying process: For EU/non-EU buyers – requirements (tax number, bank account, permits), transaction costs (transfer tax, notary, legal fees), and ongoing taxes.


5. Rental/ROI angle: If I buy, what rental yields can I expect in inland vs coastal areas?


6. Local listing resources: key real-estate websites or local agencies in each area that focus on everyday homes, not luxury villas.



Avoid generic luxury-market info. Answer with citations and share sources.
