Sure! Here’s a refined prompt to get focused, practical, and expert-level TypeScript feature toggle utilities like we discussed — with minimal API, conditional logic wrapping, URL override support, and performance-like start/end calls:

Prompt for ChatGPT as Senior Software Engineer:

I want a minimal, practical TypeScript utility to handle feature toggles in React apps with these requirements:

Support in-memory flags and URL search param overrides (using nuqs or similar)

Provide an API to wrap code blocks or functions so they only run if the feature flag is enabled

Include a performance API style where I can call start(flag) and end(flag) to conditionally run procedural code blocks

Minimal code changes needed to integrate; ideally I can wrap existing logic without refactoring too much

Support usage inside React components (hooks) and outside React (plain functions)

Simple, well-typed, and easy to maintain

Show usage examples for React components, functional wrappers, and procedural code blocks

Optional: run(flag, fn), wrap(flag, fn), and start(flag)/end(flag) methods for flexible toggling patterns


Avoid unrelated complexity like remote config or full provider contexts for now.

Write the utility using TypeScript, with React compatibility, and include concise usage examples.

Would you like me to help write the full prompt for your use?
