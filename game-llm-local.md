Got it — here's a revised, generalized specification for LLM integration in your game architecture. It keeps NPC/dialog use as an example but positions the integration as a core infrastructure layer for broader logic handling — like dynamic narrative, adaptive rules, or procedural mechanics.

📄 Specification: Client-Side LLM Integration in Browser Game Architecture

✅ Objective

Integrate a lightweight, client-side language model runtime into a browser-based game built with React + TypeScript + Rsbuild, enabling rich, adaptive logic across multiple game systems — with full offline support and minimal performance cost.


---

🎯 Goals

Provide a generic, embeddable LLM runtime for local inference in browser.

Ensure non-blocking interaction by running inference in a dedicated Web Worker.

Support both text generation and task-specific inference (e.g., classification, intent parsing).

Design for reuse across multiple game systems (not just dialog).



---

💡 Functional Scope

Key Capabilities

Local language model inference using @xenova/transformers.

Fully browser-executed using WebAssembly or WebGPU (no server).

Generic APIs exposed to the game client:

init(modelName): lazy model loading

generate(prompt, options): text generation

Future: classify(text) / embed(text)



Example Use Cases (Non-binding)

Adaptive dialogue systems

Procedural content generation

Player intent parsing / command routing

Dynamic quest/story generation

Behavior tuning for AI agents

🧠 Architecture Overview

Components

Module	Purpose

llm.worker.ts	Web Worker that loads and runs a transformer model
workerClient.ts	Comlink wrapper for calling worker methods asynchronously
GameLLM.ts (facade)	Game-side service layer that exposes a clean LLM interface
UI / Systems	Consumers of LLM results (e.g., dialogue, procedural gen)


Interaction Flow

1. Game logic requests LLM initialization (LLM.init()).


2. Game system submits text prompt or input (LLM.generate()).


3. Worker runs model computation and returns the result asynchronously.


4. Caller receives result via Promise (non-blocking).


5. Result feeds into game logic or UI state.

⚙️ Technology Stack

Concern	Technology	Rationale

LLM inference	@xenova/transformers	No backend required, WASM/WebGPU auto-selected
Worker threading	Native Web Worker + comlink	Simple async interface, avoids UI thread blocking
Model format	HuggingFace-compatible	Access to open-source models, easy to swap/extend
Game runtime	React + Rsbuild + TypeScript	Native support for modules, workers, and WASM



---

🧪 Performance Considerations

Model Footprint

distilgpt2: ~100–150MB model weight, ~200–400MB RAM when active

Load time: ~5–10s on desktop-class browsers

Execution time: ~0.5–2s for small (30–50 token) generations


Performance Mitigations

Lazy loading: only initialize when needed

Async interface: UI remains responsive (handled in worker)

Model selection: lighter models (e.g., bert-tiny) for classification tasks

WebGPU preferred if available; fallback to WASM


Known Constraints

Mobile: slower load and execution times

Memory: aggressive GC may unload models on resource-constrained devices

Cold start latency: needs buffering or loading indicators



---

🧩 API Design

LLM Facade Interface (Game-side)

interface GameLLM {
  init(modelName: string): Promise<void>;
  generate(prompt: string, options?: { maxTokens?: number }): Promise<string>;
}

Worker Interface (Exposed via comlink)

type LLMWorker = {
  init(): Promise<void>;
  generate(prompt: string, maxTokens: number): Promise<string>;
};


---

✅ Requirements

Core

[ ] Web Worker module with async LLM support

[ ] Comlink interface bridging main thread <-> worker

[ ] Lazy model loading + error handling

[ ] Generic generate(prompt) call interface

[ ] React-compatible usage in game systems


Optional / Stretch

[ ] Switchable models (e.g., task-specific vs. generative)

[ ] Embedding / classification support (via different pipeline)

[ ] Result caching or prompt deduplication

[ ] On-device model persistence (IndexedDB)



---

📦 Deliverables

File / Module	Description

src/workers/llm.worker.ts	Handles inference, runs in its own thread
src/utils/workerClient.ts	Wraps worker with Comlink
src/services/GameLLM.ts	Optional abstraction layer for DI/testability
Example consumer module	Example integration into a system (dialog, etc.)



---

🔍 Validation Criteria

Scenario	Expected Result

LLM not initialized	API throws or logs structured error
First-time model load	Loads model and runs inference within ~10s
Text generation w/ prompt	Returns response within <2s for 30 tokens
UI freeze during inference	None (handled in Web Worker)
Low-end device	Works with fallback to WASM; slower but functional
Model swap or re-init	Clean re-load; previous state released



---

🔚 Summary

This specification defines a clean and generic integration layer for running transformer-based language models fully client-side within a React + Rsbuild game application. The architecture uses Web Workers for non-blocking performance and Comlink for simplified communication.

While dialog generation is a primary use case, this LLM infrastructure is designed to support a range of core game systems: from narrative control to procedural logic, player input parsing, and adaptive behavior.

It’s scalable, modular, and future-proof for any logic-driven features you might want powered by language models.
