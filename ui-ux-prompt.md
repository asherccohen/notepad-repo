UX Patterns for AI Applications

Introduction

AI-powered apps introduce new UX challenges. These include streaming content, error recovery, inline editing, multi-modal inputs, session persistence, and visible progress indicators. This document defines robust UX patterns—based on production experience—that make AI apps feel responsive, clear, and user-controlled.


---

1. Streaming Output UX

Problem

LLMs take time to respond. Without feedback, users feel stuck.

Pattern

Use a streaming backend and render tokens as they arrive.

Backend: Use Server-Sent Events, chunked fetch, or WebSockets

Frontend: Render streaming content progressively


Implementation

Monospaced container

Animated ellipsis or blinking cursor to indicate live output

AbortController for canceling generation


Tools

Vercel AI SDK: createStreamableValue() for managing stream state

react-markdown, shiki: for styled token rendering

Stop/Retry controls



---

2. Persistent and Resumable Sessions

Problem

Users return to apps expecting continuity.

Pattern

Store complete session history, state, and context.

Database: Supabase/Postgres to persist conversations, steps, edits

Rehydrate session with prior context or fork points


UX

List past sessions with timestamp + rename option

Fork from any previous step

Show summaries or last input/output in session list



---

3. Editable Output and Inline Commands

Problem

Users want to modify AI responses directly.

Pattern

Make AI output editable and trigger inline reprocessing.

Use contentEditable or rich text frameworks

Highlight editable areas

Extract diff for resubmission


Tools

@tiptap/core, platejs

Inline "Rewrite this" buttons

Prompt injection from inline commands



---

4. Transparent Model Progress

Problem

AI internals are opaque. Users want insight.

Pattern

Visualize token stream, tool usage, or agent state.

Stream latency per token or block

Progress bars for long actions

Logs or steps timeline


Implementation

Show "Planning", "Searching", "Drafting" states

Skeleton components while loading

Trace view for advanced users



---

5. Interruptibility and Error Recovery

Problem

LLMs can fail, stall, or hallucinate.

Pattern

Give users control to cancel, retry, and understand failures.

Stop and Retry buttons during generation

Catch and surface backend/API errors

Preserve prior state after failure


UX

Use toast for recoverable issues (e.g., retry with delay)

Show detailed error dialogs for dev/debug mode



---

6. Multi-modal and Multi-turn Interaction

Problem

Real tasks often span multiple inputs, outputs, and turns.

Pattern

Structure state across turns and allow file/image/chart interactions.

Model app as a state machine (e.g., with XState)

Serialize full interaction state per session

Visual components for structured inputs (file upload, selector, slider)


Tools

xstate, zod, @uploadthing/react

Custom React components for charts/maps/media



---

7. Context Injection and Personalization

Problem

Generic LLMs need app-specific data to be useful.

Pattern

Inject user-specific context via system prompts, structured objects, or metadata.

Show active context visibly

Allow editing session context (goals, preferences)

Store reusable context templates


UX

Context summary bar

Toggle to preview exact prompt

Import/export context settings



---

8. Prompt Customization and Power Tools

Problem

Power users want prompt control. Novices want safety.

Pattern

Expose optional prompt templates, parameters, and editor.

Recent prompt history per user

System + user prompt diff view

Save/share named prompt templates


Tools

monaco-editor, CodeMirror

Prompt metadata with execution logs



---

9. Agent-style Interfaces

Problem

LLMs calling tools (APIs, search, calculators) are confusing if not visualized.

Pattern

Display steps taken by agents with labeled stages.

Timeline of tool calls with live status

Manual override of agent actions

Step-by-step logs and debuggers


Tools

LangGraph, custom step tracers

Logs with latency, tool metadata, and return values

Simulated agent replays for development



---

10. Accessibility, Performance, Mobile

Tips

Use @radix-ui for accessible UI primitives

Make streaming text screen-reader compatible

Mobile: collapse stale outputs, pause animation, debounce input

Ensure UI remains responsive even on poor connections



---

Summary

Designing AI UX requires clarity, fallback paths, and visibility. These patterns focus on robustness and user trust. Treat each as a modular capability to build consistent and trustworthy LLM-powered applications. Reuse these as part of your design system for AI apps.
