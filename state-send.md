Got it.

You're enforcing:

All events must be { type: string, payload: unknown }

No extra shape — just a discriminated union based on type

Devs handle all transitions imperatively inside switch(state), then switch(event.type)

context is a single mutable object (like XState's context)

You want a utility hook like:


const [state, context, send, setContext] = useEventState(...)

✅ Updated Type Definitions

type EventObject<T extends string = string, P = unknown> = {
  type: T;
  payload: P;
};

type Send<E extends EventObject> = (event: E) => void;

export function useEventState<
  State extends string,
  Context,
  E extends EventObject
>(
  initialState: State,
  initialContext: Context,
  options: {
    guards?: Record<string, (ctx: Context, payload: unknown) => boolean>;
    actions?: Record<string, (ctx: Context, payload: unknown, send: Send<E>) => void>;
  }
): [State, Context, Send<E>, React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<Context>>, React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<State>>] {
  const [state, setState] = useState<State>(initialState);
  const [context, setContext] = useState<Context>(initialContext);
  const { guards = {}, actions = {} } = options;

  const send: Send<E> = (event) => {
    // no logic here – dev handles everything outside
  };

  return [state, context, send, setContext, setState];
}

✅ Example Usage (fully typed, no abstractions)

type State = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';

type Context = {
  data: unknown | null;
  error: unknown | null;
};

type Events =
  | { type: 'LOAD'; payload: null }
  | { type: 'SUCCESS'; payload: unknown }
  | { type: 'ERROR'; payload: unknown };

const guards = {
  canLoad: (ctx: Context, _payload: unknown) => ctx.data == null,
};

const actions = {
  fetchData: (_ctx: Context, _payload: unknown, send: (event: Events) => void) => {
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => send({ type: 'SUCCESS', payload: data }))
      .catch(err => send({ type: 'ERROR', payload: err }));
  },
  logLoadStart: () => console.log('Starting load'),
};

function Example() {
  const [state, context, send, setContext, setState] = useEventState<State, Context, Events>(
    'idle',
    { data: null, error: null },
    { guards, actions }
  );

  const handleEvent = (event: Events) => {
    switch (state) {
      case 'idle': {
        switch (event.type) {
          case 'LOAD': {
            if (!guards.canLoad(context, event.payload)) return;

            actions.logLoadStart(context, event.payload, send);
            actions.fetchData(context, event.payload, send);
            setState('loading');
            return;
          }
        }
        break;
      }

      case 'loading': {
        switch (event.type) {
          case 'SUCCESS': {
            setContext(prev => ({ ...prev, data: event.payload, error: null }));
            setState('success');
            return;
          }

          case 'ERROR': {
            setContext(prev => ({ ...prev, error: event.payload, data: null }));
            setState('error');
            return;
          }
        }
        break;
      }

      case 'success':
      case 'error': {
        switch (event.type) {
          case 'LOAD': {
            setContext({ data: null, error: null });
            actions.fetchData(context, event.payload, send);
            setState('loading');
            return;
          }
        }
        break;
      }
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {state === 'idle' && <button onClick={() => handleEvent({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null })}>Load</button>}
      {state === 'loading' && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {state === 'success' && <pre>{JSON.stringify(context.data, null, 2)}</pre>}
      {state === 'error' && (
        <div>
          <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{String(context.error)}</p>
          <button onClick={() => handleEvent({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null })}>Retry</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

💡 Notes

All events follow the { type, payload } pattern.

Type-safe — send() and event.payload are correctly inferred.

You write manual transitions, close to setState, setContext, guard, action.

You still get strong typing and structure without any abstraction or runtime magic.


Want a generic helper like createEventMap() to generate types from event declarations automatically? I can add that too.




This pattern you've defined — a manual, imperative event-state machine built with useState, guards, and actions — is elegant for senior developers with mental models shaped by state machines or message passing. But let’s analyze it deeply through three lenses:


---

1. ✅ Developer Experience & Learning Curve

Pros

Fully explicit control flow:
Devs can see every state transition and side effect happening inline — no hidden logic, no abstraction layers.

Testable in isolation:
Since actions and guards are external functions, they can be tested independently without mocking React internals.

No dependency on XState, Redux, etc.:
It keeps the dependency tree small and gives teams full control over logic without committing to a complex framework.

Composable mental model:
For experienced devs, this is the closest you can get to Elm-style or actor-model logic within React, while still staying React-native.


Cons

Verbosity and boilerplate:
For devs unfamiliar with event-driven design, this introduces unfamiliar ceremony:

Event types

Discriminated unions

Guard pattern

Externalized actions


Error-prone for junior devs:
Having to manually manage setState, setContext, and manually ensure correct effects run makes it very easy to mess up transitions:

You can forget to call setContext

You can conditionally fire actions and introduce bugs that are harder to debug than declarative useEffect-style flows


No fallback mental model:
There’s no reducer or hook pattern to fall back to. If the logic becomes complex or stateful actions require retries/cancellation/debouncing, junior devs may not know how to adapt this model.



---

2. ⚛️ React’s Rendering Model & Potential Pitfalls

This is critical to consider.

Safe Areas

✅ useState calls are side-effect free

✅ setContext and setState calls are React-compliant

✅ No mutations of state objects

✅ Side effects (like fetch) are fired in response to events — not directly during render


So from a React perspective, this pattern won’t break anything by default.

Risk Areas

2.1: Inconsistent state after concurrent updates

If you trigger multiple send() calls in quick succession (e.g. via button spam, retries), context and state may desync. Example:

setContext(prev => ({ ...prev, data: A }));
setState('success');

// in another tick:
setContext(prev => ({ ...prev, data: B }));
setState('success');

If these two are fired concurrently, React may batch them in unexpected ways, leading to UI showing a state (success) with the wrong data (B from a race condition).

✅ Fix: wrap both in a single transition function and avoid race conditions — or, for high concurrency scenarios, you'll need a reducer-style atomic update or useTransition.

2.2: Side-effects fired outside of useEffect

You're calling fetch() directly in actions — not inside useEffect.

That’s OK if those actions are only called inside send() (triggered by user events or internal logic), not during render.

🚨 But it becomes dangerous if a dev calls send(...) in render accidentally — it would cause side effects during render, which is a strict violation in concurrent React.

✅ Fix: make a rule in your team that no send() calls are allowed in render or lifecycle setup.


---

3. 🔮 Future-Proofing & Scalability

This pattern is great for localized flows (modals, forms, single-page wizards), but if the app grows:

✅ Scales well for:

UI components with finite control states

Data fetchers with retry logic

UIs where you want event logs for debugging


⚠️ Starts to break down when:

You need parallel states (e.g. two flows active at once)

You want to pause/cancel effects (like aborting fetch or debounce)

You want built-in history, undo, devtools, replay

You want to track state transitions outside of components (e.g. global store)


At that point, the verbosity becomes a bottleneck, and introducing a state-machine engine or custom event bus might become necessary.


---

🧠 Conclusion

This is a well-reasoned pattern for:

Local state machines

Devs who value control

Scenarios where XState or reducers feel too abstract


But you should:

1. Enforce strong conventions (e.g. never call send() in render, always co-update state + context).


2. Educate junior devs on event-driven patterns and finite state modeling.


3. Avoid uncontrolled concurrency (use debouncing/throttling/cancellation for async actions).


4. Consider wrapping the pattern later with utilities (transition, match, etc.) to reduce manual boilerplate when scaling.



Would you like me to build a dev-mode logger or visualizer for transitions (state + context) to help less experienced devs understand what’s happening?



Absolutely. Misusing send in React — especially in this low-abstraction, imperative state model — can easily introduce subtle bugs, side effects during render, and state inconsistency.

Here are realistic misuse cases that can break the app or violate React's rendering model:


---

❌ 1. Calling send() inside render

return (
  <div>
    {someCondition && send({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null })} // 🚨
  </div>
);

🧨 Why it's bad:

This triggers an update during render — forbidden in React.

You’ll get an error like:
“Cannot update a component (X) while rendering a different component (X).”

It breaks React’s assumption of a pure render phase.



---

❌ 2. Calling send() during useState initializer

const [state] = useEventState(...);
const [count, setCount] = useState(() => {
  send({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 }); // 🚨
  return 0;
});

🧨 Why it's bad:

React will call the initializer during render.

You're again triggering a state change during render.

React's concurrent renderer might call it multiple times — leading to multiple send() calls unexpectedly.



---

❌ 3. Calling send() in top-level code

const [state, context, send] = useEventState(...);

send({ type: 'INIT', payload: null }); // 🚨

🧨 Why it's bad:

This will run on every render.

Infinite loop guaranteed if send() causes a state change → re-render → send() again.



---

❌ 4. Calling send() inside an uncontrolled useEffect (no deps)

useEffect(() => {
  send({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null }); // 🚨 will re-run every render
});

🧨 Why it's bad:

Without a [] dependency array or a once guard, this will re-run every render.

Results in an infinite effect/send loop if not carefully handled.


✅ Correct version:

useEffect(() => {
  send({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null });
}, []);

Or conditionally:

useEffect(() => {
  if (state === 'idle') {
    send({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null });
  }
}, [state]);


---

❌ 5. Calling send() inside derived render logic

if (context.needsRetry) {
  send({ type: 'RETRY', payload: null }); // 🚨
}

Even though this looks like logic, if it's inside render (not in a hook), it breaks React's rules.


---

✅ Safe places to call send():

Inside event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)

Inside controlled useEffect

Inside actions (if those are invoked imperatively from events)

Inside custom lifecycle wrappers (e.g. useLayoutEffect, useEffect with care)



---

🧠 Best Practice: Add a runtime check in dev

Add this utility:

let isRendering = false;

export function markRenderStart() {
  isRendering = true;
}
export function markRenderEnd() {
  isRendering = false;
}

export function safeSend<E extends EventObject>(send: (e: E) => void): (e: E) => void {
  return (event: E) => {
    if (isRendering) {
      console.warn('[send] was called during render. This is forbidden.');
    }
    send(event);
  };
}

Use in your component:

markRenderStart();
const output = (
  <div> ... </div>
);
markRenderEnd();

return output;


---

✅ Want to prevent this at compile time?

It’s possible to build a small linter rule or wrap send() calls in a proxy that tracks usage during render. Let me know and I’ll show you how.
