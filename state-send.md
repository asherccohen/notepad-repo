Got it.

You're enforcing:

All events must be { type: string, payload: unknown }

No extra shape ‚Äî just a discriminated union based on type

Devs handle all transitions imperatively inside switch(state), then switch(event.type)

context is a single mutable object (like XState's context)

You want a utility hook like:


const [state, context, send, setContext] = useEventState(...)

‚úÖ Updated Type Definitions

type EventObject<T extends string = string, P = unknown> = {
  type: T;
  payload: P;
};

type Send<E extends EventObject> = (event: E) => void;

export function useEventState<
  State extends string,
  Context,
  E extends EventObject
>(
  initialState: State,
  initialContext: Context,
  options: {
    guards?: Record<string, (ctx: Context, payload: unknown) => boolean>;
    actions?: Record<string, (ctx: Context, payload: unknown, send: Send<E>) => void>;
  }
): [State, Context, Send<E>, React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<Context>>, React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<State>>] {
  const [state, setState] = useState<State>(initialState);
  const [context, setContext] = useState<Context>(initialContext);
  const { guards = {}, actions = {} } = options;

  const send: Send<E> = (event) => {
    // no logic here ‚Äì dev handles everything outside
  };

  return [state, context, send, setContext, setState];
}

‚úÖ Example Usage (fully typed, no abstractions)

type State = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';

type Context = {
  data: unknown | null;
  error: unknown | null;
};

type Events =
  | { type: 'LOAD'; payload: null }
  | { type: 'SUCCESS'; payload: unknown }
  | { type: 'ERROR'; payload: unknown };

const guards = {
  canLoad: (ctx: Context, _payload: unknown) => ctx.data == null,
};

const actions = {
  fetchData: (_ctx: Context, _payload: unknown, send: (event: Events) => void) => {
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => send({ type: 'SUCCESS', payload: data }))
      .catch(err => send({ type: 'ERROR', payload: err }));
  },
  logLoadStart: () => console.log('Starting load'),
};

function Example() {
  const [state, context, send, setContext, setState] = useEventState<State, Context, Events>(
    'idle',
    { data: null, error: null },
    { guards, actions }
  );

  const handleEvent = (event: Events) => {
    switch (state) {
      case 'idle': {
        switch (event.type) {
          case 'LOAD': {
            if (!guards.canLoad(context, event.payload)) return;

            actions.logLoadStart(context, event.payload, send);
            actions.fetchData(context, event.payload, send);
            setState('loading');
            return;
          }
        }
        break;
      }

      case 'loading': {
        switch (event.type) {
          case 'SUCCESS': {
            setContext(prev => ({ ...prev, data: event.payload, error: null }));
            setState('success');
            return;
          }

          case 'ERROR': {
            setContext(prev => ({ ...prev, error: event.payload, data: null }));
            setState('error');
            return;
          }
        }
        break;
      }

      case 'success':
      case 'error': {
        switch (event.type) {
          case 'LOAD': {
            setContext({ data: null, error: null });
            actions.fetchData(context, event.payload, send);
            setState('loading');
            return;
          }
        }
        break;
      }
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {state === 'idle' && <button onClick={() => handleEvent({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null })}>Load</button>}
      {state === 'loading' && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {state === 'success' && <pre>{JSON.stringify(context.data, null, 2)}</pre>}
      {state === 'error' && (
        <div>
          <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{String(context.error)}</p>
          <button onClick={() => handleEvent({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null })}>Retry</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

üí° Notes

All events follow the { type, payload } pattern.

Type-safe ‚Äî send() and event.payload are correctly inferred.

You write manual transitions, close to setState, setContext, guard, action.

You still get strong typing and structure without any abstraction or runtime magic.


Want a generic helper like createEventMap() to generate types from event declarations automatically? I can add that too.




This pattern you've defined ‚Äî a manual, imperative event-state machine built with useState, guards, and actions ‚Äî is elegant for senior developers with mental models shaped by state machines or message passing. But let‚Äôs analyze it deeply through three lenses:


---

1. ‚úÖ Developer Experience & Learning Curve

Pros

Fully explicit control flow:
Devs can see every state transition and side effect happening inline ‚Äî no hidden logic, no abstraction layers.

Testable in isolation:
Since actions and guards are external functions, they can be tested independently without mocking React internals.

No dependency on XState, Redux, etc.:
It keeps the dependency tree small and gives teams full control over logic without committing to a complex framework.

Composable mental model:
For experienced devs, this is the closest you can get to Elm-style or actor-model logic within React, while still staying React-native.


Cons

Verbosity and boilerplate:
For devs unfamiliar with event-driven design, this introduces unfamiliar ceremony:

Event types

Discriminated unions

Guard pattern

Externalized actions


Error-prone for junior devs:
Having to manually manage setState, setContext, and manually ensure correct effects run makes it very easy to mess up transitions:

You can forget to call setContext

You can conditionally fire actions and introduce bugs that are harder to debug than declarative useEffect-style flows


No fallback mental model:
There‚Äôs no reducer or hook pattern to fall back to. If the logic becomes complex or stateful actions require retries/cancellation/debouncing, junior devs may not know how to adapt this model.



---

2. ‚öõÔ∏è React‚Äôs Rendering Model & Potential Pitfalls

This is critical to consider.

Safe Areas

‚úÖ useState calls are side-effect free

‚úÖ setContext and setState calls are React-compliant

‚úÖ No mutations of state objects

‚úÖ Side effects (like fetch) are fired in response to events ‚Äî not directly during render


So from a React perspective, this pattern won‚Äôt break anything by default.

Risk Areas

2.1: Inconsistent state after concurrent updates

If you trigger multiple send() calls in quick succession (e.g. via button spam, retries), context and state may desync. Example:

setContext(prev => ({ ...prev, data: A }));
setState('success');

// in another tick:
setContext(prev => ({ ...prev, data: B }));
setState('success');

If these two are fired concurrently, React may batch them in unexpected ways, leading to UI showing a state (success) with the wrong data (B from a race condition).

‚úÖ Fix: wrap both in a single transition function and avoid race conditions ‚Äî or, for high concurrency scenarios, you'll need a reducer-style atomic update or useTransition.

2.2: Side-effects fired outside of useEffect

You're calling fetch() directly in actions ‚Äî not inside useEffect.

That‚Äôs OK if those actions are only called inside send() (triggered by user events or internal logic), not during render.

üö® But it becomes dangerous if a dev calls send(...) in render accidentally ‚Äî it would cause side effects during render, which is a strict violation in concurrent React.

‚úÖ Fix: make a rule in your team that no send() calls are allowed in render or lifecycle setup.


---

3. üîÆ Future-Proofing & Scalability

This pattern is great for localized flows (modals, forms, single-page wizards), but if the app grows:

‚úÖ Scales well for:

UI components with finite control states

Data fetchers with retry logic

UIs where you want event logs for debugging


‚ö†Ô∏è Starts to break down when:

You need parallel states (e.g. two flows active at once)

You want to pause/cancel effects (like aborting fetch or debounce)

You want built-in history, undo, devtools, replay

You want to track state transitions outside of components (e.g. global store)


At that point, the verbosity becomes a bottleneck, and introducing a state-machine engine or custom event bus might become necessary.


---

üß† Conclusion

This is a well-reasoned pattern for:

Local state machines

Devs who value control

Scenarios where XState or reducers feel too abstract


But you should:

1. Enforce strong conventions (e.g. never call send() in render, always co-update state + context).


2. Educate junior devs on event-driven patterns and finite state modeling.


3. Avoid uncontrolled concurrency (use debouncing/throttling/cancellation for async actions).


4. Consider wrapping the pattern later with utilities (transition, match, etc.) to reduce manual boilerplate when scaling.



Would you like me to build a dev-mode logger or visualizer for transitions (state + context) to help less experienced devs understand what‚Äôs happening?



Absolutely. Misusing send in React ‚Äî especially in this low-abstraction, imperative state model ‚Äî can easily introduce subtle bugs, side effects during render, and state inconsistency.

Here are realistic misuse cases that can break the app or violate React's rendering model:


---

‚ùå 1. Calling send() inside render

return (
  <div>
    {someCondition && send({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null })} // üö®
  </div>
);

üß® Why it's bad:

This triggers an update during render ‚Äî forbidden in React.

You‚Äôll get an error like:
‚ÄúCannot update a component (X) while rendering a different component (X).‚Äù

It breaks React‚Äôs assumption of a pure render phase.



---

‚ùå 2. Calling send() during useState initializer

const [state] = useEventState(...);
const [count, setCount] = useState(() => {
  send({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 }); // üö®
  return 0;
});

üß® Why it's bad:

React will call the initializer during render.

You're again triggering a state change during render.

React's concurrent renderer might call it multiple times ‚Äî leading to multiple send() calls unexpectedly.



---

‚ùå 3. Calling send() in top-level code

const [state, context, send] = useEventState(...);

send({ type: 'INIT', payload: null }); // üö®

üß® Why it's bad:

This will run on every render.

Infinite loop guaranteed if send() causes a state change ‚Üí re-render ‚Üí send() again.



---

‚ùå 4. Calling send() inside an uncontrolled useEffect (no deps)

useEffect(() => {
  send({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null }); // üö® will re-run every render
});

üß® Why it's bad:

Without a [] dependency array or a once guard, this will re-run every render.

Results in an infinite effect/send loop if not carefully handled.


‚úÖ Correct version:

useEffect(() => {
  send({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null });
}, []);

Or conditionally:

useEffect(() => {
  if (state === 'idle') {
    send({ type: 'LOAD', payload: null });
  }
}, [state]);


---

‚ùå 5. Calling send() inside derived render logic

if (context.needsRetry) {
  send({ type: 'RETRY', payload: null }); // üö®
}

Even though this looks like logic, if it's inside render (not in a hook), it breaks React's rules.


---

‚úÖ Safe places to call send():

Inside event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)

Inside controlled useEffect

Inside actions (if those are invoked imperatively from events)

Inside custom lifecycle wrappers (e.g. useLayoutEffect, useEffect with care)



---

üß† Best Practice: Add a runtime check in dev

Add this utility:

let isRendering = false;

export function markRenderStart() {
  isRendering = true;
}
export function markRenderEnd() {
  isRendering = false;
}

export function safeSend<E extends EventObject>(send: (e: E) => void): (e: E) => void {
  return (event: E) => {
    if (isRendering) {
      console.warn('[send] was called during render. This is forbidden.');
    }
    send(event);
  };
}

Use in your component:

markRenderStart();
const output = (
  <div> ... </div>
);
markRenderEnd();

return output;


---

‚úÖ Want to prevent this at compile time?

It‚Äôs possible to build a small linter rule or wrap send() calls in a proxy that tracks usage during render. Let me know and I‚Äôll show you how.
