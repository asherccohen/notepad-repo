🖥️ Key Concepts

Rendering (painting pixels) – simply drawing visual changes — is inexpensive for the browser.

Layout (also called reflow/recalculation) – determining positioning and sizing of every element — is costly and slow. Even small layout changes force much work.



---

🚦 When Layout Becomes Expensive

Changing size or position (e.g. width, height, margins, padding) triggers layout, forcing recalculation of the page structure.

Any element updates that affect its geometry will cause expensive reflow up the tree, potentially involving hundreds or thousands of DOM nodes.



---

⚡️ Optimizing Updates

UI changes that don’t require reflow (e.g. changing opacity, transforms, or painting offscreen compositing) are much cheaper.

For example:

// Instead of conditional rendering:
{ showModal && <Modal /> }
// Better:
<Modal style={{ opacity: showModal ? 1 : 0 }} />

This allows the component to stay in the compositor layer without triggering a re-layout.



---

📱 React and Mobile Context

On platforms like React Native, conditional mounting/unmounting components can be heavy, especially deep component trees.

Hiding via transform or opacity (so that layout hasn’t changed) retains position without incurring re-compute costs.




---

🧭 Practical Advice for UI Engineers

Minimize layout-triggering changes—avoid adjusting width/height/margins often.

Prefer updates to GPU-accelerated properties: opacity, transform, and others that stay in the compositing layer.

When dynamic visibility is needed, favor hiding rather than unmounting to avoid re-layout overhead.

TL;DR

Rendering—the act of drawing—is cheap. Layout—the act of measuring and positioning—is expensive. Use techniques like opacity and transforms to avoid costly layout operations and optimize UI performance.

Let me know if you’d like code examples or how to apply this in a React or React Native component!



 — using opacity or transform to "hide" complex components like modals isn't practical in most real-world apps. Especially when:

The modal does data fetching or init logic

It has internal state (e.g. form inputs, navigation)

It's a security-sensitive view (e.g. user tokens or sensitive content)


In those cases, keeping it mounted just to avoid layout cost can backfire — you trade a micro-optimization for complexity, potential bugs, or even security issues.

So yes — use opacity or transform only for purely presentational, lightweight elements like:

Animating a tooltip in/out

Sliding panels that don’t do much inside

Image transitions

Skeleton loaders

Now, about other layout (reflow) bottlenecks, beyond modals:

Here’s where layout can hurt you:


---

🔄 DOM-Dependent Calculations

Using layout-dependent properties in JS (like element.offsetTop, getBoundingClientRect(), scrollHeight) causes a forced reflow — the browser must flush any pending changes first to return accurate values.

Example:

const top = element.getBoundingClientRect().top;
element.style.height = top + 'px';

This causes layout thrashing: read → write → read → write.


---

🔁 Animating Layout Properties

Animating properties like:

width

height

margin

padding

top / left


...triggers layout on every frame. This is much more expensive than animating transform or opacity, which only hit the compositor.


---

📐 Deep DOM Trees with Flex/Grid

Modern layout systems like Flexbox or Grid make layout easier, but they expand layout scope. Changing one element's size can bubble up and force layout recalculations throughout a large subtree.

Example: resizing a child inside a deeply nested grid layout can ripple across siblings and parents.


---

📊 Tables and Complex CSS

<table> layouts are notorious for reflow bottlenecks.

Elements with position: sticky or dynamic column widths make it worse.

CSS with calc() depending on other elements can also be problematic.



---

🧠 Font and Content Size Changes

Dynamic font loading, or content injection (e.g. translation strings or async text), can cause unpredictable reflows.


---

🧼 Summary: What to Avoid

Action	Causes Layout?	Better Alternative

Changing width, height, top, left	✅ Yes	Use transform if possible
Accessing layout props (offsetTop)	✅ Yes	Batch reads/writes
Animating size or margins	✅ Yes	Animate scale instead
Changing deeply nested grid/flex children	✅ Yes	Minimize nesting depth
