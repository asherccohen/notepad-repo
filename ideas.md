- why not preprocessors? solo dev Vs team. We don't say no if you know what you're doing, but don't forget of the team
- styling and atomic classes
- one level of abstraction. Avoid libraries, more shareable and copy/pastable code. There are tradeoffs
- architecture, folder structures and conventions
- more

Perfect. Let‚Äôs take each example/industry from your original post and break down real problems worth solving. These are based on observable pain points, inefficiencies, or lack of good tools in each domain‚Äîstuff you can realistically prototype as a dev.

üöö Transport / Logistics

Example idea: Local delivery dispatch system
Problems to solve:

Small businesses rely on WhatsApp/pen and paper to assign drivers

No real-time driver tracking or status updates

Customers don‚Äôt know estimated delivery times or delays

Route planning is manual (or nonexistent)

No performance dashboard for delivery times or failures


Breakdown to build:

Driver app (mobile or web) ‚Üí set status, accept jobs

Dispatcher dashboard ‚Üí assign jobs, track drivers

Customer view ‚Üí check delivery status via a link

Daily reports ‚Üí # of deliveries, delays, canceled jobs



---

üçΩÔ∏è Booking Systems (Flights, Restaurants, Medical, etc.)

Example idea: Multi-channel appointment scheduling
Problems to solve:

Businesses use phone/email but get double bookings

No shows hurt revenue, but there's no automated reminders

Availability isn't visible in real-time

Customers often fill out the same info repeatedly

No analytics on peak hours or booking patterns


Breakdown to build:

Admin UI for managing open slots

Public-facing booking flow with confirmations

Reminder system via SMS or email

Calendar sync (Google, Outlook)

Simple export/reporting dashboard



---

‚ôªÔ∏è Waste Management (Municipal / Private)

Example idea: Citizen waste pickup portal
Problems to solve:

Pickup times change, but residents aren't notified

No way to report missed pickups or illegal dumping

Municipal workers lack route optimization

No visibility into collection metrics for decision-makers


Breakdown to build:

QR/postal-code based lookup of schedule

Optional SMS/email notifications

Simple complaint form + photo upload

Worker-facing UI for route tracking

Dashboard with basic KPIs (missed pickups, total waste volume, etc.)



---

üì¶ Inventory Management (SMBs, Freelancers, Events)

Example idea: Simple inventory tracker for food vendors or crafters
Problems to solve:

Sellers track inventory in Google Sheets or notebooks

No alerts for low stock or expiring items

Manual entry is tedious and error-prone

No syncing across devices or team members


Breakdown to build:

CRUD UI for items + quantity tracking

Low stock alerts via push or email

Simple barcode scan support (QR or camera input)

History log (when something was added/removed)

Optional multi-user sharing + permissions



---

üßπ Internal Tooling at Work (Once You‚Äôre Hired)

Example idea: Slack-integrated daily check-in bot
Problems to solve:

Team leads chase status updates every morning

People forget standups or block each other unknowingly

No easy tracking of what was planned vs. done

Missed or duplicated work due to poor async comms


Breakdown to build:

Slack bot that asks questions every morning

Collects responses in a Google Sheet or Notion

Generates a team summary and sends it to a channel

Optional tagging/blockers system

Export past check-ins into reports
