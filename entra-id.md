Here’s your question reformulated as a single, self-contained LLM prompt with context and constraints included:


---

Prompt:
I’m running a Node.js application inside a Docker container that uses the @azure/identity package to authenticate with Azure. I want to know if I need to install the Azure CLI inside the container.

The application could use DefaultAzureCredential, which can try multiple authentication methods:

AzureCliCredential → Requires the Azure CLI to be installed in the container because it obtains tokens by invoking az. If I use this, I must install Azure CLI (e.g., FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli or curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | bash) and authenticate (e.g., az login). Alternatively, I can mount the .azure directory from my host to the container, but that has security implications.

ManagedIdentityCredential → No Azure CLI required. Works when running in Azure with a system- or user-assigned managed identity (e.g., ACI, AKS, App Service). The container must have the managed identity enabled and permissions assigned.

EnvironmentCredential → No Azure CLI required. I can provide credentials via environment variables (AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET).


Given these details, explain whether the Azure CLI is necessary in my Docker container for @azure/identity to work, and outline the available authentication approaches with pros/cons.


---

Do you want me to also make an optimized “few-shot” style prompt so future LLMs can answer similar questions with richer technical depth? That way, you could reuse it.



Here’s a consolidated prompt you can reuse with any LLM to get a clear, context-aware answer based on everything we discussed:


---

Prompt:

I’m building an internal tool for a multinational banking company using Next.js App Router, next-auth, Microsoft Entra ID (Microsoft’s Azure AD successor), Drizzle ORM with Postgres, and @ai-sdk/azure for Azure OpenAI integration.

I need:

1. Authentication

Users should log in via Microsoft SSO (Entra ID provider in next-auth).

I want to skip a manual login page and redirect unauthenticated users straight to Microsoft’s SSO screen.

I want to know if next-auth uses an env var for JWT verification or if with Entra ID it verifies via Entra infrastructure instead.

I also want to understand how having multiple next-auth providers works — whether it shows multiple sign-in options automatically (even if I’m not using next-auth UI components).



2. Entra ID credentials

How to obtain and configure the client ID, client secret, and issuer URL (now used instead of tenant ID) from the Azure portal.

Whether the Azure client_id and client_secret used in @azure/identity are the same ones used for the Entra ID provider in next-auth.



3. Database integration (Drizzle ORM)

I want to store and monitor users for auditing and analytics, even though Microsoft SSO could work without a DB.

I’m using Drizzle with Postgres and want a schema for users and accounts tables, and a Drizzle adapter for next-auth so user data is persisted automatically.

I need advice on when a DB is required versus when JWT-only auth is enough.



4. Azure OpenAI authentication

I’m using createAzure from @ai-sdk/azure (Vercel’s AI SDK) and sometimes pass headers (bearer token), but it still expects an API key.

I want to understand the relationship between next-auth Entra ID login tokens, Azure OpenAI authentication, and @azure/identity.

I want to know how to support both API key and bearer token flows for Azure OpenAI in the same app.




Please explain in detail, using latest package names and latest env var conventions, including:

Step-by-step Entra ID setup in Azure portal

next-auth configuration with the Entra ID provider

Middleware redirect logic for SSO without a login page

Drizzle schema + adapter for next-auth

How to handle Azure OpenAI API auth with both API keys and bearer tokens

How next-auth sessions relate to Azure OpenAI credentials



---

Do you want me to now refine this prompt so it’s concise but still keeps all the technical depth so you can reuse it in any LLM without losing context? That way you could drop it into ChatGPT or Claude and always get a consistent, complete answer.



Here’s your conversation distilled into a clear, ready-to-use LLM prompt so another model can directly give you the integration guidance you wanted:


---

Prompt:

> I’m building a Next.js App Router app using next-auth, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL.

Current state:

Authentication uses the CredentialsProvider with a login/register page.

I have a users table in Drizzle and use the session to fetch/store user-specific data (e.g., messages).

JWTs are signed with AUTH_SECRET.


Goal:

Replace the CredentialsProvider with Microsoft Entra ID using the azure-ad provider in next-auth.


What I need:

1. How to configure the Entra ID provider in next-auth and implement the signIn and jwt callbacks to:

Create a user in my users table if they don’t exist

Retrieve the DB user ID and attach it to the JWT/session



2. Whether I should remove my login/register UI, and what to replace it with


3. Best practice for session structure — should I attach user ID, email, or both?


4. How to keep my existing “fetch messages for a user” logic working when identity comes from OAuth instead of credentials


5. Any recommended schema changes to users for OAuth (e.g., provider fields)


6. How to test and debug the Microsoft Entra ID OAuth flow locally



Assume:

I’m using TypeScript, Drizzle with PostgreSQL, and the Next.js App Router (not Pages Router)

I want concise, correct TypeScript code snippets for the solution





---

Do you want me to now optimize this prompt so the LLM’s answer comes in a step-by-step “playbook” format like the one I gave you earlier? That would make it more implementation-ready.



Microsoft Entra ID + NextAuth.js + Azure OpenAI + @ai-sdk/azure: Internal Auth Architecture

Context

Internal documentation for an enterprise-grade internal tool at a multinational banking company using Next.js, NextAuth.js, Microsoft Entra ID, @azure/identity, and @ai-sdk/azure. This doc explains user authentication, secure token exchange, and usage of Azure OpenAI both with API Key and token-based auth.

Supports:

Local development

Cloud deployment (Docker + Kubernetes)

Part 1 – Microsoft Entra ID Authentication with NextAuth.js

To authenticate users or backend services using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), you'll need to register an application and retrieve credentials like client_id, client_secret, and optionally configure scopes and redirect URIs. Here's a step-by-step guide to do this properly in 2024 using the latest Microsoft Entra portal:


---

1. Sign in to Microsoft Entra Admin Center

Go to: https://entra.microsoft.com

Use a Microsoft 365 work/school account with admin privileges (or developer tenant).


---

2. Register a New App

1. Navigate to "Applications" → "App registrations"


2. Click "New registration"



Fill in:

Name: e.g., NextAuth Entra App

Supported account types:

Choose "Accounts in this organizational directory only" for internal use

Choose "Multitenant" if needed across tenants


Redirect URI (optional for now):

If using NextAuth, add:

http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/entra-id

Replace localhost with your prod domain later.



Click "Register"


---

3. Get Your Credentials

Once registered, you’ll see:

Application (client) ID → use as AZURE_CLIENT_ID

Directory (tenant) ID → needed only for some flows, like client credentials

Object ID → ignore unless doing advanced role access



---

4. Create a Client Secret (for server-side use)

1. In the App’s sidebar, go to Certificates & secrets


2. Under Client secrets, click "New client secret"


3. Add a name like prod-secret, set expiry (12 months is fine)


4. Save it — you’ll only see the Value once → use this as AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET




---

5. Configure Redirect URIs

For web-based logins (like next-auth):

1. Go to "Authentication"


2. Under Web, click "Add a platform"


3. Choose Web, and input:

http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/entra-id

Or production:

https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/entra-id



Check:

Access tokens (enabled)

ID tokens (enabled)


Click Save


---

6. (Optional) Expose API or Add Scopes

If your backend or Azure OpenAI requires custom scopes:

Go to "Expose an API"

Add scopes like api://<client_id>/.default



---

7. (Optional) Assign API Permissions

For service-to-service calls or admin consent:

1. Go to API permissions


2. Click "Add a permission"


3. Choose:

Microsoft Graph (for user info)

Custom APIs if you registered another backend app



4. Click "Grant admin consent" if needed for all users




---

Summary of Variables for .env

AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<from portal>
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<from Certificates & Secrets>
AZURE_TENANT_ID=<optional, needed for client credential flow>
AZURE_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/v2.0
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<your secret>


---

Let me know if you're using next-auth, @azure/identity, or @ai-sdk/azure, and I can tailor examples for each with those credentials.



Provider

Use next-auth/providers/microsoft-entra-id. It replaces the old azure-ad provider.

Required ENV Vars

AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_ID=<Application (client) ID>
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret>
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0

Example config

// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import EntraIdProvider from 'next-auth/providers/microsoft-entra-id';

const handler = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    EntraIdProvider({
      clientId: process.env.AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_SECRET!,
      issuer: process.env.AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER!,
    }),
  ],
  session: { strategy: 'jwt' },
  callbacks: {
    async jwt({ token, account }) {
      if (account) token.access_token = account.access_token;
      return token;
    },
    async session({ session, token }) {
      session.accessToken = token.access_token;
      return session;
    },
  },
});

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };

Token verification behavior

When using a provider (like Entra ID), NextAuth verifies JWTs using the issuer's JWKS.

If no provider is used, it falls back to verifying using the NEXTAUTH_SECRET env var.

So yes, you can write conditional logic:


if (process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET) {
  // fallback to local signing key
} else {
  // trust Microsoft Entra infrastructure
}

Part 2 – Azure OpenAI Auth via @ai-sdk/azure

Packages involved

@ai-sdk/azure: OpenAI access layer by Vercel

@azure/identity: Microsoft lib for acquiring tokens


Approaches

1. API key-based auth (default, simplest)


2. Bearer token via Microsoft Entra (for secure enterprise flows)



Vercel’s createAzure method

import { createAzure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';

const model = createAzure({
  baseUrl: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL!,
  deployment: 'gpt-4',
  apiKey: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY!,
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});

Gotcha

Even if you send an Authorization header with a bearer token, the lib still expects an apiKey, or else it throws. This is likely due to current implementation defaults.


---

Part 3 – Getting Bearer Tokens via @azure/identity

import { ClientSecretCredential } from '@azure/identity';

const credential = new ClientSecretCredential(
  process.env.AZURE_TENANT_ID!,
  process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID!,
  process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET!
);

const token = await credential.getToken('https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default');

> Observation: Even fake client_id and client_secret may return valid tokens in some dev setups. This could be due to cached credentials or fallback to other credential flows.




---

Part 4 – Auth flow summary

Context	Who is Authenticated	Auth Provider	Token Type

User Login	Interactive user	NextAuth via Entra	ID token / Access token
API-to-API	Server app	@azure/identity	Bearer token
OpenAI Access	Server app	@ai-sdk/azure	API key + (optionally) Bearer token



---

Part 5 – Questions Answered

Q: Do I need to pass tokens manually to Azure OpenAI?

A: If using bearer tokens, yes. Set them via headers. But apiKey is still required by the SDK.

Q: What’s the difference in token verification?

A: If you use Entra ID via provider, NextAuth uses Microsoft’s JWKS. If no provider is used, it uses NEXTAUTH_SECRET locally.

Q: What’s the default provider in NextAuth?

A: There is none. You must explicitly configure one. If no provider is configured and you still got authenticated, your app might have a fallback logic (e.g. a custom Credentials provider).


---

Let me know if you want this formatted as markdown or turned into a Confluence wiki page.

----

Yes, you can create a login flow with NextAuth + Entra ID that skips your own login screen and immediately redirects to the Microsoft SSO login — just like internal tools in enterprise environments.

Here's how it works:

Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) supports SSO via redirect. If the user is already authenticated with Microsoft (e.g. via Microsoft 365), Entra ID will auto-sign them in, and they’ll land back on your app without needing to interact.


---

To enable this in NextAuth.js (App Router)

1. Use the Microsoft Entra ID Provider



// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import EntraIDProvider from 'next-auth/providers/microsoft-entra-id';

const handler = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    EntraIDProvider({
      clientId: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET!,
      issuer: process.env.AZURE_ISSUER!, // e.g. https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/v2.0
    }),
  ],
  session: {
    strategy: 'jwt',
  },
});

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };

2. Redirect to login immediately if user is not authenticated



In your middleware:

// middleware.ts
import { auth } from 'next-auth';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function middleware(req) {
  const session = await auth();
  if (!session) {
    const callbackUrl = req.nextUrl.href;
    return NextResponse.redirect(
      new URL(`/api/auth/signin/entra-id?callbackUrl=${encodeURIComponent(callbackUrl)}`, req.url),
    );
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*'], // protect routes
};

3. Optional: Force login via Microsoft silently



To get SSO without interaction:

Make sure prompt=none is respected.

Microsoft login behavior depends on:

Whether the user is already signed in to Microsoft

Whether your domain is federated

The tenant’s policy



You can customize this by editing the authorization URL:

EntraIDProvider({
  // ...
  authorization: {
    params: {
      prompt: 'none', // or 'login' if you want a fresh login every time
    },
  },
});


---

Summary

Yes, you can skip your own login page and redirect straight to Microsoft login.

If users are already logged into Microsoft, SSO will auto-sign them in — no interaction.

You still need to trigger the sign-in explicitly via a redirect — use middleware or layout checks to do that.


Let me know if you want a client-only version (e.g. for a login button in a React component).

------
Great — if you're using Drizzle and want to monitor users, then yes, you should persist users in your own Postgres DB. This gives you full control over user tracking, audit, access control, etc.

Here’s exactly how to wire it up.


---

1. Add Drizzle Tables for NextAuth

NextAuth doesn't have official Drizzle support yet, so you’ll define your own schema. You can use this basic structure (can be extended later):

// schema/auth.ts
import { pgTable, text, timestamp, varchar } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const users = pgTable('users', {
  id: varchar('id', { length: 255 }).primaryKey(),
  name: text('name'),
  email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
  emailVerified: timestamp('email_verified', { mode: 'date' }),
  image: text('image'),
});

export const accounts = pgTable('accounts', {
  userId: varchar('user_id', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  type: text('type').notNull(),
  provider: text('provider').notNull(),
  providerAccountId: text('provider_account_id').notNull(),
  accessToken: text('access_token'),
  tokenType: text('token_type'),
  idToken: text('id_token'),
});

You can add sessions and verification tokens if you want to use a DB session strategy too.


---

2. Add a Custom Adapter

You need a custom Drizzle adapter. Since there's no official one yet, use this community adapter or write a thin one yourself. A solid open-source one:
drizzle-next-auth
Or I can help you write a minimal one.

Then wire it into your NextAuth config:

import { DrizzleAdapter } from './your-drizzle-adapter';
import { db } from '@/lib/drizzle'; // your drizzle client

const handler = NextAuth({
  adapter: DrizzleAdapter(db),
  providers: [
    EntraIDProvider({
      clientId: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET!,
      issuer: process.env.AZURE_ISSUER!,
    }),
  ],
});


---

3. Monitor Users

Now you can:

Query the users table for audit, dashboards, admin panels

Track accounts to know where users logged in from

Optionally, relate users to teams, roles, etc.


You’ll also have access to their Microsoft profile data (name, email, avatar) at login.


---

TL;DR

Use Drizzle with a custom adapter

Define users and accounts tables

Add the adapter to NextAuth config

Microsoft Entra ID provider fills these on login

You can now fully monitor and extend user activity


Let me know if you want me to generate the full Drizzle adapter for NextAuth.
