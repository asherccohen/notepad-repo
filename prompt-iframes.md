Sure! Here's a refined prompt format to get a clear, expert-level response like the one above, focused on the Sonar flag for <iframe> use:


---

Prompt:

> I’m a software engineer and my static code analysis tool (SonarQube/SonarCloud) flagged an <iframe> usage in my code.

Explain why <iframe> can trigger security or maintainability warnings in Sonar.

Detail the common risks and best practices to mitigate them in a web app (e.g., sandboxing, CSP, trusted sources).

Suggest alternatives if <iframe> should be avoided.

Provide concise code examples in React/TypeScript for secure <iframe> usage.

If applicable, how to properly suppress or document exceptions in Sonar.


Keep it technical, clear, and practical.

Here’s a focused, clear prompt format to get precise, engineer-level answers about React Router behavior in iframes, including search params:


---

Prompt:
I’m building a React app embedded inside an iframe using react-router’s BrowserRouter. I want to understand how routing behaves inside the iframe, specifically:

Does BrowserRouter operate on the iframe’s internal URL or the parent browser’s URL?

How does it handle search parameters (location.search or useSearchParams) inside the iframe?

What are the caveats or gotchas related to deep linking, URL updates, and navigation within the iframe?

Are there any special considerations for cross-origin iframes?

When is it better to use HashRouter or MemoryRouter instead of BrowserRouter inside an iframe?


Please answer as a software engineer with practical experience, focusing on the technical behavior, limitations, and best practices. Provide concise, clear explanations without fluff.
