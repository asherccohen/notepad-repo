Here’s a focused, clear prompt format to get precise, engineer-level answers about React Router behavior in iframes, including search params:


---

Prompt:
I’m building a React app embedded inside an iframe using react-router’s BrowserRouter. I want to understand how routing behaves inside the iframe, specifically:

Does BrowserRouter operate on the iframe’s internal URL or the parent browser’s URL?

How does it handle search parameters (location.search or useSearchParams) inside the iframe?

What are the caveats or gotchas related to deep linking, URL updates, and navigation within the iframe?

Are there any special considerations for cross-origin iframes?

When is it better to use HashRouter or MemoryRouter instead of BrowserRouter inside an iframe?


Please answer as a software engineer with practical experience, focusing on the technical behavior, limitations, and best practices. Provide concise, clear explanations without fluff.

If you want, I can help you tailor it more specifically.
