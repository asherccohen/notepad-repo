Hereâ€™s a focused, powerful prompt format to get sharp, engineer-level answers about React form validation patterns and custom validation messages:


---

Prompt:

> Act as a senior software engineer specializing in React and TypeScript forms.
I want you to analyze best practices and patterns from leading form libraries like React Hook Form and Conform.
Focus on:

validation triggers (blur vs change vs submit)

submission strategies (submit-on-change vs submit-button, external submit buttons)

client-side validation architecture and error handling

integrating native browser validation messages with React state, including pros and cons

schema-first validation patterns and progressive enhancement

accessibility best practices and dynamic fields handling


Provide clear, concise explanations and practical code snippets in TypeScript with React.
Avoid generic platitudes. Prioritize actionable patterns and trade-offs.
Highlight where native browser APIs fit versus when full library integration is needed.

Want me to help you turn this into a reusable prompt template?




Sure! Here's a refined, focused prompt format you can use to get clear, expert-level responses like the one above:


---

Prompt:

I have a React controlled input component that visually shows an asterisk when a field is required. The problem is:

If I use the native required attribute, the browser triggers its built-in HTML5 validation, which I want to avoid.

I prefer to validate using TypeScript and Zod, handling errors via state and displaying custom error messages/popups.

If I remove the required attribute to stop native validation, I lose the asterisk in the UI, which hurts UX.


How can I implement this cleanly and accessibly? Please provide a solution that:

Preserves the visual cue (asterisk) for required fields.

Prevents native HTML validation from interfering.

Supports accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes).

Works well in a controlled React input scenario.

Uses best practices for form validation with Zod.


Please include a concise code snippet in TypeScript/React demonstrating the recommended pattern.

If you want, I can help you refine it further or tailor it for a specific context.
