Sure! Here's a refined, focused prompt format you can use to get clear, expert-level responses like the one above:

Prompt:

I have a React controlled input component that visually shows an asterisk when a field is required. The problem is:

If I use the native required attribute, the browser triggers its built-in HTML5 validation, which I want to avoid.

I prefer to validate using TypeScript and Zod, handling errors via state and displaying custom error messages/popups.

If I remove the required attribute to stop native validation, I lose the asterisk in the UI, which hurts UX.


How can I implement this cleanly and accessibly? Please provide a solution that:

Preserves the visual cue (asterisk) for required fields.

Prevents native HTML validation from interfering.

Supports accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes).

Works well in a controlled React input scenario.

Uses best practices for form validation with Zod.


Please include a concise code snippet in TypeScript/React demonstrating the recommended pattern.

If you want, I can help you refine it further or tailor it for a specific context.
