Here’s a consolidated, LLM-ready prompt based on everything you asked and the solutions we iterated on:


---

Prompt:
I want to design a resilient, scalable, and declarative system to handle complex dependent fields in a web form.
A field can:

Change visibility (show / hide)

Change enabled state (enable / disable)

Have its dropdown options filtered dynamically based on other fields’ values

Depend on multiple fields (dependsOn: string[])

Have nested dependencies (dependencies of dependencies)


I want:

1. A declarative API to define rules as data, not scattered logic.


2. Functional style — pure functions, immutability, composability.


3. Mathematical structure — model the dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):

Nodes = fields

Edges = dependencies

Use topological sort to determine evaluation order

Detect and prevent cycles



4. Boolean logic to define conditions cleanly.


5. Dynamic dropdown options that can be static or computed from form state.


6. Evaluation function that takes the form values and rules and outputs for each field:

{ visible: boolean; enabled: boolean; options?: Option[] }


7. Integration in React (TypeScript) using controlled components.


8. Server-side validation possibility using something like Zod to enforce business rules.


9. Testing with Playwright for user-facing behavior.



Here’s an outline of what I’m looking for in the answer:

Type definitions for FieldConfig and Option.

Example fieldConfigs for country → region → city dependencies.

Functions to:

Build the dependency graph

Topologically sort fields

Evaluate field states based on rules and current values


React integration example using hooks.

Explanation of why the DAG + functional + declarative approach is resilient and maintainable.


The answer should be:

In TypeScript

Using React for the UI example

Written for someone who already understands frontend architecture patterns

Concise but with enough code to be directly implemented

Do you want me to also include our final DAG-based React + TypeScript implementation inside this prompt so it’s fully self-contained for an LLM? That would make it copy-paste ready.



Sure! Here’s a concise prompt you can use with an LLM to get similar help, including your constraints and the solutions we discussed:


---

Prompt:

I’m building complex dependent fields in React forms with the following requirements:

I want to avoid useEffect for setting dependent field state after async data fetches or user input.

I prefer plain React with useState and reducer dispatch event patterns, no useReducer with side effects complexity.

I want a centralized, declarative rule engine expressed as a schema of dependency rules:

Each rule links a source field to one or more target fields.

A compute function derives target field values from source field values and full form state.


The rule engine should:

Detect source field changes and update target fields automatically.

Handle both automatic updates (e.g., dropdown options refetched and the dependent dropdown value auto-set if only one option) and manual user-driven changes.

Process all changes (automatic or manual) through a single reducer event handler to keep logic consolidated.


I use React Query to fetch schemas/options keyed by a source field (e.g. companyId).

I want to avoid resetting the entire form state (e.g., no key tricks).

I want to avoid using React Hook Form or similar form libraries.

The solution should be easily extensible and keep the dependency logic clean and centralized.

I’m open to a minimal TypeScript implementation showing:

The rules schema type

The reducer logic applying rules after each relevant event

How to dispatch user input and async fetch results through the reducer to apply rules

The hook usage integrating with React state and dispatch



Can you help me design and implement this kind of rule-driven dependent fields engine for React forms?


---

Would you like me to help generate a full working example based on this?



Sure! Here’s a prompt you can use to get a solid LLM answer on this topic, combining your context and the solutions we discussed:


---

Prompt:

I have a React form component that receives a defaultValues prop to populate its internal form state. In some cases, these defaultValues change dynamically—often after an API call triggered by user input (e.g., changing a dropdown triggers a refetch for options). I want the form to update accordingly without losing user input or resetting unrelated fields.

I am not using react-hook-form initially, so I manage form state manually (e.g., useState or useReducer).

How can I best update the form state reactively when defaultValues change asynchronously, without fully resetting the form and losing user edits?

What are good patterns to patch only the relevant fields?

How can I avoid the anti-pattern of blindly overwriting the whole form state on defaultValues change?


Also:

If I switch to react-hook-form, how can I make defaultValues reactive so the form updates automatically when they change asynchronously?

Are there built-in hooks or props in the latest react-hook-form that handle this use case cleanly?


Please provide clear examples using useState or useReducer for manual state management, and explain how to use the values prop and resetOptions in react-hook-form for reactive updates.

That prompt covers all the key points and will help any LLM or engineer give you a targeted, useful answer. Want me to help draft a snippet or test case for your specific stack?



Here’s a distilled LLM prompt from our exchange:


---

Prompt:
I’m building a dynamic form system in a React/Remix/TypeScript stack. The backend sends a JSON schema that defines field rules such as minLength, maxLength, and pattern. The requirements are:

1. Schema-driven form validation — schema comes from the backend and should be the single source of truth for validation rules.


2. Dependent fields — the value of one field can change the required/optional status or other validation attributes of other fields.


3. Form reuse — the same schema sections (e.g., address form) should be reusable in multiple contexts (like domicile vs postal address).



Given these requirements, is schema-based validation conceptually recommended? How should I handle:

JSON schema parsing and validation at runtime

Conditional logic between fields

Schema reuse across scenarios

UI-only behaviours (show/hide) and async validations that go beyond schema


Answer with architectural recommendations and concrete examples relevant to React/Remix/TypeScript.


---

Do you want me to also include the key recommendations from our discussion into that prompt so an LLM can both understand and continue the conversation from where we left off?



Here’s a focused, powerful prompt format to get sharp, engineer-level answers about React form validation patterns and custom validation messages:


---

Prompt:

> Act as a senior software engineer specializing in React and TypeScript forms.
I want you to analyze best practices and patterns from leading form libraries like React Hook Form and Conform.
Focus on:

validation triggers (blur vs change vs submit)

submission strategies (submit-on-change vs submit-button, external submit buttons)

client-side validation architecture and error handling

integrating native browser validation messages with React state, including pros and cons

schema-first validation patterns and progressive enhancement

accessibility best practices and dynamic fields handling


Provide clear, concise explanations and practical code snippets in TypeScript with React.
Avoid generic platitudes. Prioritize actionable patterns and trade-offs.
Highlight where native browser APIs fit versus when full library integration is needed.




---

Want me to help you turn this into a reusable prompt template?




Sure! Here's a refined, focused prompt format you can use to get clear, expert-level responses like the one above:


---

Prompt:

I have a React controlled input component that visually shows an asterisk when a field is required. The problem is:

If I use the native required attribute, the browser triggers its built-in HTML5 validation, which I want to avoid.

I prefer to validate using TypeScript and Zod, handling errors via state and displaying custom error messages/popups.

If I remove the required attribute to stop native validation, I lose the asterisk in the UI, which hurts UX.


How can I implement this cleanly and accessibly? Please provide a solution that:

Preserves the visual cue (asterisk) for required fields.

Prevents native HTML validation from interfering.

Supports accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes).

Works well in a controlled React input scenario.

Uses best practices for form validation with Zod.


Please include a concise code snippet in TypeScript/React demonstrating the recommended pattern.


---

If you want, I can help you refine it further or tailor it for a specific context.
