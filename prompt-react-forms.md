Sure! Here’s a prompt you can use to get a solid LLM answer on this topic, combining your context and the solutions we discussed:


---

Prompt:

I have a React form component that receives a defaultValues prop to populate its internal form state. In some cases, these defaultValues change dynamically—often after an API call triggered by user input (e.g., changing a dropdown triggers a refetch for options). I want the form to update accordingly without losing user input or resetting unrelated fields.

I am not using react-hook-form initially, so I manage form state manually (e.g., useState or useReducer).

How can I best update the form state reactively when defaultValues change asynchronously, without fully resetting the form and losing user edits?

What are good patterns to patch only the relevant fields?

How can I avoid the anti-pattern of blindly overwriting the whole form state on defaultValues change?


Also:

If I switch to react-hook-form, how can I make defaultValues reactive so the form updates automatically when they change asynchronously?

Are there built-in hooks or props in the latest react-hook-form that handle this use case cleanly?


Please provide clear examples using useState or useReducer for manual state management, and explain how to use the values prop and resetOptions in react-hook-form for reactive updates.

That prompt covers all the key points and will help any LLM or engineer give you a targeted, useful answer. Want me to help draft a snippet or test case for your specific stack?



Here’s a distilled LLM prompt from our exchange:


---

Prompt:
I’m building a dynamic form system in a React/Remix/TypeScript stack. The backend sends a JSON schema that defines field rules such as minLength, maxLength, and pattern. The requirements are:

1. Schema-driven form validation — schema comes from the backend and should be the single source of truth for validation rules.


2. Dependent fields — the value of one field can change the required/optional status or other validation attributes of other fields.


3. Form reuse — the same schema sections (e.g., address form) should be reusable in multiple contexts (like domicile vs postal address).



Given these requirements, is schema-based validation conceptually recommended? How should I handle:

JSON schema parsing and validation at runtime

Conditional logic between fields

Schema reuse across scenarios

UI-only behaviours (show/hide) and async validations that go beyond schema


Answer with architectural recommendations and concrete examples relevant to React/Remix/TypeScript.

Do you want me to also include the key recommendations from our discussion into that prompt so an LLM can both understand and continue the conversation from where we left off?



Here’s a focused, powerful prompt format to get sharp, engineer-level answers about React form validation patterns and custom validation messages:


---

Prompt:

> Act as a senior software engineer specializing in React and TypeScript forms.
I want you to analyze best practices and patterns from leading form libraries like React Hook Form and Conform.
Focus on:

validation triggers (blur vs change vs submit)

submission strategies (submit-on-change vs submit-button, external submit buttons)

client-side validation architecture and error handling

integrating native browser validation messages with React state, including pros and cons

schema-first validation patterns and progressive enhancement

accessibility best practices and dynamic fields handling


Provide clear, concise explanations and practical code snippets in TypeScript with React.
Avoid generic platitudes. Prioritize actionable patterns and trade-offs.
Highlight where native browser APIs fit versus when full library integration is needed.

Want me to help you turn this into a reusable prompt template?




Sure! Here's a refined, focused prompt format you can use to get clear, expert-level responses like the one above:


---

Prompt:

I have a React controlled input component that visually shows an asterisk when a field is required. The problem is:

If I use the native required attribute, the browser triggers its built-in HTML5 validation, which I want to avoid.

I prefer to validate using TypeScript and Zod, handling errors via state and displaying custom error messages/popups.

If I remove the required attribute to stop native validation, I lose the asterisk in the UI, which hurts UX.


How can I implement this cleanly and accessibly? Please provide a solution that:

Preserves the visual cue (asterisk) for required fields.

Prevents native HTML validation from interfering.

Supports accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes).

Works well in a controlled React input scenario.

Uses best practices for form validation with Zod.


Please include a concise code snippet in TypeScript/React demonstrating the recommended pattern.

If you want, I can help you refine it further or tailor it for a specific context.
