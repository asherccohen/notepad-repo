## Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Consultation
```
User Query → Orchestrator → Relevant Agent → Response → Orchestrator → User
```
**Use Case**: Simple, domain-specific questions
**Example**: "What's our code review process?" → Engineering Manager Agent

### Pattern 2: Parallel Multi-Agent Consultation
```
User Query → Orchestrator → [Agent A, Agent B, Agent C] → Synthesis Agent → User
```
**Use Case**: Complex questions requiring multiple perspectives
**Example**: "Can we implement OAuth with Google for our customer portal?"
- Security Agent: Security implications and requirements
- Legal Agent: Data privacy and compliance considerations
- Engineering Manager Agent: Technical implementation approach
- Synthesis Agent: Combines all inputs into actionable recommendation

### Pattern 3: Agent-to-Agent Collaboration
```
User Query → Orchestrator → Agent A → Agent B → Agent A → Orchestrator → User
```
**Use Case**: Questions where agents need to collaborate and negotiate
**Example**: Engineering Manager Agent consults HR Agent about team capacity before making sprint commitments

### Pattern 4: Escalation Chain
```
User Query → Agent A → [Needs More Info] → Agent B → [Still Unclear] → Human Escalation
```
**Use Case**: When automated agents need human manager input

## Implementation with Vercel AI SDK

### Agent Structure
```typescript
interface Agent {
  id: string;
  role: string;
  persona: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  knowledgeBase: string[];
  escalationThreshold: number;
}

interface AgentResponse {
  agentId: string;
  confidence: number;
  response: string;
  needsMoreInfo: boolean;
  suggestedCollaborators: string[];
  escalationNeeded: boolean;
}
```

### Orchestration Flow
1. **Query Classification**: Orchestrator analyzes query and determines required agents
2. **Agent Selection**: Route to specific agents or broadcast to multiple agents
3. **Response Collection**: Gather responses from all consulted agents
4. **Synthesis**: Merger agent combines responses into coherent answer
5. **Quality Check**: Validate completeness and consistency
6. **Response Delivery**: Present unified response to user

### Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
```typescript
interface AgentMessage {
  fromAgent: string;
  toAgent: string;
  messageType: 'consultation' | 'information' | 'decision';
  context: any;
  query: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

## Conversation Flow Examples

### Example 1: Simple Query
**User**: "What's our policy on using third-party JavaScript libraries?"

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator → Engineering Manager Agent
2. Engineering Manager Agent responds with technical policies
3. Orchestrator delivers answer to user

### Example 2: Complex Multi-Domain Query
**User**: "We want to add AI-powered chatbot to our customer service. What do we need to consider?"

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator broadcasts to: Product Manager, Legal, Security, Engineering Manager
2. Parallel responses:
   - Product Manager: Customer impact, feature requirements, success metrics
   - Legal Agent: Data privacy, terms of service updates, liability
   - Security Agent: Data security, access controls, threat vectors
   - Engineering Manager: Technical implementation, resources needed, timeline
3. Synthesis Agent combines responses into comprehensive implementation plan
4. Orchestrator presents unified recommendation

### Example 3: Agent Collaboration
**User**: "Should we hire two senior developers or four junior developers for the new mobile team?"

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator → HR Agent (budget, hiring timeline, market conditions)
2. HR Agent → Engineering Manager Agent (technical requirements, mentorship capacity)
3. Engineering Manager → Product Manager Agent (project timeline, complexity)
4. Synthesis Agent creates recommendation weighing all factors
5. Orchestrator delivers decision with rationale

## Knowledge Integration

### Agent Knowledge Sources
- **Company Policies**: Centralized policy database accessible to all agents
- **Historical Decisions**: Shared decision history for consistency
- **External APIs**: Integration with HR systems, project management tools, etc.
- **Real-time Data**: Current team capacity, budget status, project timelines

### Context Sharing
```typescript
interface ConversationContext {
  userId: string;
  conversationId: string;
  queryHistory: Array<{query: string, responses: AgentResponse[]}>;
  relevantPolicies: string[];
  currentProject?: string;
  teamContext?: string;
}
```

## Response Synthesis Strategy

### The Synthesis Agent
A specialized agent that:
- Identifies conflicts or contradictions between agent responses
- Prioritizes information based on query context
- Creates coherent narrative from multiple perspectives
- Flags areas needing human review
- Provides confidence scores for different aspects of the response

### Synthesis Patterns
1. **Consensus**: All agents agree → Present unified answer
2. **Majority**: Most agents agree → Present majority view with minority concerns noted
3. **Conflict**: Agents disagree → Present options with trade-offs
4. **Insufficient Info**: Agents need more data → Escalate with specific questions

## User Interaction Patterns

### Follow-up Question Handling
- Maintain conversation context across questions
- Route follow-ups to same agents unless new domains are introduced
- Allow users to request specific agent perspectives
- Enable "deep dive" mode for complex topics

### Feedback Integration
- Users can rate response quality
- Flag incorrect or unhelpful responses
- Request alternative perspectives
- Escalate to human managers when needed

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### Agent Unavailability
- Graceful degradation when specific agents are offline
- Cross-training between agents for basic coverage
- Clear communication about reduced capability modes

### Confidence Thresholds
- Agents indicate confidence levels in their responses
- Low confidence triggers additional consultation or escalation
- Users see confidence indicators in responses

### Human Escalation
- Clear triggers for when human input is needed
- Prepared briefing packages for human managers
- Seamless handoff between AI and human decision-makers
