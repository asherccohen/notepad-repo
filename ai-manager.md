# AI Manager Assistant - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The AI Manager Assistant is an intelligent decision-support system that replaces traditional management bottlenecks in software development workflows. Instead of automating developer tasks, this system automates the non-productive overhead of management decision-making, policy interpretation, and cross-functional coordination that typically slows down development cycles.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points
- Developers spend 20-40% of their time waiting for management decisions and clarifications
- Simple policy questions require multiple email chains and meeting requests
- Cross-functional coordination (legal, HR, compliance) creates weeks-long delays
- Managers become bottlenecks for routine decisions that could be automated
- Inconsistent interpretation of company policies across different managers
- Knowledge silos prevent developers from accessing information they need to proceed

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Software developers and engineering teams
- **Secondary**: Engineering managers, product managers, technical leads
- **Tertiary**: Cross-functional teams (Legal, HR, Compliance, Security)

## Solution Overview

The AI Manager Assistant acts as an intelligent intermediary that can:
1. Answer policy and procedural questions instantly
2. Make routine management decisions based on established criteria
3. Coordinate with other AI bots (Legal, HR, Security) for complex decisions
4. Escalate to human managers only when necessary
5. Maintain audit trails and decision rationale

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Core Decision-Making Engine

- **Legal Bot Integration**: Contract interpretation, compliance requirements, IP considerations
- **HR Bot Integration**: Team composition, hiring priorities, performance considerations
- **Security Bot Integration**: Security requirements, threat assessments, compliance mandates
- **Finance Bot Integration**: Budget approvals, cost analysis, ROI calculations
- **Customer Success Bot Integration**: Customer impact analysis, support ticket correlation

### Communication & Escalation
- **Automated Inquiry System**: Submit questions to relevant distribution lists when information is unclear
- **Wait State Management**: Track pending inquiries and provide status updates to developers
- **Smart Escalation**: Identify when human intervention is truly needed
- **Stakeholder Notification**: Automatically inform relevant parties of decisions made

### Knowledge Management
- **Requirement Clarification**: Proactively identify ambiguous requirements and seek clarification
- **Decision Precedents**: Learn from previous decisions to ensure consistency
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation history and decision rationale
- **Documentation Generation**: Create decision summaries and action items

## User Workflows

### Primary Workflow: Developer Query Resolution
1. Developer asks question through preferred interface (Slack, email, web portal)
2. AI Manager analyzes query and determines required information sources
3. System consults relevant policies, precedents, and data sources
4. If information is complete, AI provides decision with rationale
5. If information is missing, system submits inquiries to appropriate teams
6. AI waits for responses, aggregates information, and provides final decision
7. Decision is logged with full audit trail

### Secondary Workflow: Proactive Decision Support
1. AI monitors development activities and identifies potential decision points
2. System proactively gathers relevant information and prepares recommendations
3. AI presents options to developer before bottlenecks occur
4. Developer receives guidance before needing to ask

### Escalation Workflow
1. AI identifies decisions beyond its scope or confidence threshold
2. System prepares comprehensive briefing for human manager
3. All relevant context, research, and recommendations are packaged
4. Human manager makes informed decision with minimal research time
5. Decision is fed back into AI system for future learning

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Decision Resolution Time**: Average time from developer query to actionable answer
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of queries requiring human manager intervention
- **Developer Productivity**: Increase in feature delivery velocity
- **Decision Consistency**: Variance in decisions for similar scenarios

### Secondary KPIs
- **Policy Compliance**: Reduction in policy violations and audit findings
- **Cross-functional Coordination Time**: Reduction in time for legal/HR/security reviews
- **Manager Efficiency**: Reduction in routine decision-making load for human managers
- **Knowledge Retention**: Reduction in repeated questions and decision requests

## Persona Definitions

### AI Manager Personas
Different AI personas for different management levels and contexts:

- **Engineering Manager**: Focus on technical decisions, team coordination, sprint planning
- **Product Manager**: Focus on feature prioritization, customer requirements, market considerations
- **Director Level**: Focus on strategic decisions, resource allocation, cross-team coordination
- **VP Level**: Focus on organizational decisions, budget considerations, company-wide implications

Each persona has appropriate authority levels and escalation thresholds.

## Integration Requirements

### Data Sources
- Company policy databases and wikis
- Customer requirement documentation
- Previous decision logs and precedents
- Team calendars and capacity information
- Budget and resource allocation systems
- Compliance and regulatory databases

### Communication Channels
- Slack/Teams integration for real-time queries
- Email integration for formal requests and external communication
- Project management tool integration (Jira, Asana, etc.)
- Calendar integration for meeting scheduling and availability
- Documentation systems (Confluence, Notion, etc.)

### External Bot Ecosystem
- Standardized API for bot-to-bot communication
- Authentication and authorization for cross-bot queries
- Shared context and decision history
- Conflict resolution mechanisms when bots disagree

## Governance & Compliance

### Decision Authority Matrix
Clear definition of what decisions each AI persona can make autonomously versus what requires human approval or escalation.

### Audit & Accountability
- Complete decision trails with reasoning and data sources
- Regular review cycles for decision quality
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Compliance reporting and monitoring

### Risk Management
- Confidence thresholds for different types of decisions
- Fallback mechanisms when AI systems are unavailable
- Regular testing and validation of decision quality
- Clear procedures for overriding AI decisions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Core decision engine with basic policy interpretation
