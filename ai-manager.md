## Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Consultation
```
User Query → Orchestrator → Relevant Agent → Response → Orchestrator → User
```
**Use Case**: Simple, domain-specific questions
**Example**: "What's our code review process?" → Engineering Manager Agent

### Pattern 2: Parallel Multi-Agent Consultation
```
User Query → Orchestrator → [Agent A, Agent B, Agent C] → Synthesis Agent → User
```
**Use Case**: Complex questions requiring multiple perspectives
**Example**: "Can we implement OAuth with Google for our customer portal?"
- Security Agent: Security implications and requirements
- Legal Agent: Data privacy and compliance considerations
- Engineering Manager Agent: Technical implementation approach
- Synthesis Agent: Combines all inputs into actionable recommendation

### Pattern 3: Agent-to-Agent Collaboration
```
User Query → Orchestrator → Agent A → Agent B → Agent A → Orchestrator → User
```
**Use Case**: Questions where agents need to collaborate and negotiate
**Example**: Engineering Manager Agent consults HR Agent about team capacity before making sprint commitments

### Pattern 4: Escalation Chain
```
User Query → Agent A → [Needs More Info] → Agent B → [Still Unclear] → Human Escalation
```
**Use Case**: When automated agents need human manager input

## Implementation with Vercel AI SDK

### Agent Structure
```typescript
interface Agent {
  id: string;
  role: string;
  persona: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  knowledgeBase: string[];
  escalationThreshold: number;
}

interface AgentResponse {
  agentId: string;
  confidence: number;
  response: string;
  needsMoreInfo: boolean;
  suggestedCollaborators: string[];
  escalationNeeded: boolean;
}
```

### Orchestration Flow
1. **Query Classification**: Orchestrator analyzes query and determines required agents
2. **Agent Selection**: Route to specific agents or broadcast to multiple agents
3. **Response Collection**: Gather responses from all consulted agents
4. **Synthesis**: Merger agent combines responses into coherent answer
5. **Quality Check**: Validate completeness and consistency
6. **Response Delivery**: Present unified response to user

### Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
```typescript
interface AgentMessage {
  fromAgent: string;
  toAgent: string;
  messageType: 'consultation' | 'information' | 'decision';
  context: any;
  query: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

## Conversation Flow Examples

### Example 1: Simple Query
**User**: "What's our policy on using third-party JavaScript libraries?"

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator → Engineering Manager Agent
2. Engineering Manager Agent responds with technical policies
3. Orchestrator delivers answer to user

### Example 2: Complex Multi-Domain Query
**User**: "We want to add AI-powered chatbot to our customer service. What do we need to consider?"

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator broadcasts to: Product Manager, Legal, Security, Engineering Manager
2. Parallel responses:
   - Product Manager: Customer impact, feature requirements, success metrics
   - Legal Agent: Data privacy, terms of service updates, liability
   - Security Agent: Data security, access controls, threat vectors
   - Engineering Manager: Technical implementation, resources needed, timeline
3. Synthesis Agent combines responses into comprehensive implementation plan
4. Orchestrator presents unified recommendation

### Example 3: Agent Collaboration
**User**: "Should we hire two senior developers or four junior developers for the new mobile team?"

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator → HR Agent (budget, hiring timeline, market conditions)
2. HR Agent → Engineering Manager Agent (technical requirements, mentorship capacity)
3. Engineering Manager → Product Manager Agent (project timeline, complexity)
4. Synthesis Agent creates recommendation weighing all factors
5. Orchestrator delivers decision with rationale

## Knowledge Integration

### Agent Knowledge Sources
- **Company Policies**: Centralized policy database accessible to all agents
- **Historical Decisions**: Shared decision history for consistency
- **External APIs**: Integration with HR systems, project management tools, etc.
- **Real-time Data**: Current team capacity, budget status, project timelines

### Context Sharing
```typescript
interface ConversationContext {
  userId: string;
  conversationId: string;
  queryHistory: Array<{query: string, responses: AgentResponse[]}>;
  relevantPolicies: string[];
  currentProject?: string;
  teamContext?: string;
}
```

## Response Synthesis Strategy

### The Synthesis Agent
A specialized agent that:
- Identifies conflicts or contradictions between agent responses
- Prioritizes information based on query context
- Creates coherent narrative from multiple perspectives
- Flags areas needing human review
- Provides confidence scores for different aspects of the response

### Synthesis Patterns
1. **Consensus**: All agents agree → Present unified answer
2. **Majority**: Most agents agree → Present majority view with minority concerns noted
3. **Conflict**: Agents disagree → Present options with trade-offs
4. **Insufficient Info**: Agents need more data → Escalate with specific questions

## User Interaction Patterns

### Follow-up Question Handling
- Maintain conversation context across questions
- Route follow-ups to same agents unless new domains are introduced
- Allow users to request specific agent perspectives
- Enable "deep dive" mode for complex topics

### Feedback Integration
- Users can rate response quality
- Flag incorrect or unhelpful responses
- Request alternative perspectives
- Escalate to human managers when needed

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### Agent Unavailability
- Graceful degradation when specific agents are offline
- Cross-training between agents for basic coverage
- Clear communication about reduced capability modes

### Confidence Thresholds
- Agents indicate confidence levels in their responses
- Low confidence triggers additional consultation or escalation
- Users see confidence indicators in responses

### Human Escalation
- Clear triggers for when human input is needed
- Prepared briefing packages for human managers
- Seamless handoff between AI and human decision-makers

## Benefits of This Architecture

### For Developers
- Single interface for all management questions
- Fast response times through parallel processing
- Consistent decision-making across teams
- Rich context and rationale for decisions

### For Organizations
- Scalable decision-making without adding management overhead
- Audit trail of all decisions and reasoning
- Consistent policy application
- Reduced management bottlenecks

### For Managers
- Focus on strategic decisions rather than routine queries
- Comprehensive briefings when escalation is needed
- Visibility into team decision patterns
- Reduced interruption from routine questions

# Decoupled Multi-Agent System Architecture

## Core Principles

The system operates on **metadata-driven orchestration** where:
- Agents are defined by their capabilities and constraints, not hardcoded workflows
- The orchestrator dynamically determines consultation patterns based on agent metadata
- New agents can be added without changing orchestration logic
- Workflows emerge from agent capabilities rather than predefined patterns

## Agent Definition Schema

### Base Agent Metadata
```typescript
interface AgentDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  
  // Capability Declaration
  capabilities: {
    domains: string[];           // ["engineering", "security", "legal"]
    expertise: string[];         // ["code-review", "architecture", "compliance"]
    keywords: string[];          // ["deployment", "GDPR", "team-capacity"]
    confidence_threshold: number; // 0.0 - 1.0
  };
  
  // Operational Constraints
  constraints: {
    max_response_time_ms: number;
    requires_human_escalation_for: string[];
    cannot_make_decisions_about: string[];

    can_consult: string[];       // Agent IDs this agent may consult
    provides_input_to: string[]; // Agent IDs that may request input from this agent
    synthesis_weight: number;    // How much weight this agent's input carries (0.0-1.0)
  };
  
  // Context Requirements
  context_needs: {
    required_data: string[];     // ["user_role", "project_context", "compliance_region"]
    optional_data: string[];
    memory_scope: "conversation" | "user" | "global";

};
```

## Dynamic Orchestration Engine

### Query Analysis & Agent Selection

```typescript
interface QueryAnalysis {
  domains: string[];
  keywords: string[];
  complexity_score: number;
  urgency: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  estimated_agents_needed: number;
}

interface AgentSelectionResult {
  primary_agents: string[];      // Must be consulted
  secondary_agents: string[];    // Should be consulted if time permits
  collaboration_chains: Array<{  // Required agent-to-agent consultations
    from: string;
    to: string;
    reason: string;
  }>;
  synthesis_strategy: "consensus" | "weighted" | "hierarchical" | "expert";
}

class DynamicOrchestrator {
  constructor(private agents: Map<string, AgentDefinition>) {}

  analyzeQuery(query: string, context: any): QueryAnalysis {
    // NLP analysis to extract domains and keywords
    // Complexity scoring based on cross-domain requirements
    // Urgency detection from language patterns
  }

  selectAgents(analysis: QueryAnalysis): AgentSelectionResult {
    const candidates = this.findCandidateAgents(analysis);
    const selected = this.optimizeAgentSelection(candidates, analysis);
    const collaborations = this.planCollaborations(selected);
    
    return {
      primary_agents: selected.primary,
      secondary_agents: selected.secondary,
      collaboration_chains: collaborations,
      synthesis_strategy: this.determineSynthesisStrategy(selected)
    };
  }

  private findCandidateAgents(analysis: QueryAnalysis): AgentMatch[] {
    return Array.from(this.agents.values()).map(agent => ({
      agent_id: agent.id,
      domain_match: this.calculateDomainOverlap(analysis.domains, agent.capabilities.domains),
      keyword_match: this.calculateKeywordOverlap(analysis.keywords, agent.capabilities.keywords),
      confidence_score: this.calculateConfidenceScore(analysis, agent)
    })).filter(match => match.domain_match > 0.1 || match.keyword_match > 0.3);
  }
}
```

### Execution Engine

```typescript
interface ExecutionPlan {
  phases: ExecutionPhase[];
  fallback_strategy: string;
  max_execution_time_ms: number;
}

interface ExecutionPhase {
  phase_id: string;
  agents: string[];
  execution_type: "parallel" | "sequential" | "conditional";
  dependencies: string[];  // Previous phase IDs that must complete
  timeout_ms: number;
}

class ExecutionEngine {
  async executeQuery(
    query: string, 
    context: any, 
    agents: Map<string, AgentDefinition>
  ): Promise<SynthesizedResponse> {
    
    // 1. Dynamic Planning
    const analysis = this.orchestrator.analyzeQuery(query, context);
    const selection = this.orchestrator.selectAgents(analysis);
    const plan = this.createExecutionPlan(selection);
    
    // 2. Execute Phases
    const phaseResults = new Map<string, AgentResponse[]>();
    
    for (const phase of plan.phases) {
      const results = await this.executePhase(phase, phaseResults, context);
      phaseResults.set(phase.phase_id, results);
    }
    
    // 3. Dynamic Synthesis
    return await this.synthesizeResponses(phaseResults, selection.synthesis_strategy);
  }

  private async executePhase(
    phase: ExecutionPhase, 
    previousResults: Map<string, AgentResponse[]>,
    context: any
  ): Promise<AgentResponse[]> {
    
    switch (phase.execution_type) {
      case "parallel":
        return await this.executeParallel(phase.agents, context);
      
      case "sequential":
        return await this.executeSequential(phase.agents, context, previousResults);
      
      case "conditional":
        return await this.executeConditional(phase.agents, context, previousResults);
    }
  }
}
```

## Agent Registry & Discovery

```typescript
class AgentRegistry {
  private agents = new Map<string, AgentDefinition>();
  private agentInstances = new Map<string, any>();

  register(definition: AgentDefinition, implementation: any) {
    this.agents.set(definition.id, definition);
    this.agentInstances.set(definition.id, implementation);
    this.updateCapabilityIndex();
  }

  findAgentsByCapability(domain: string, expertise?: string): AgentDefinition[] {
    return Array.from(this.agents.values()).filter(agent => 
      agent.capabilities.domains.includes(domain) &&
      (!expertise || agent.capabilities.expertise.includes(expertise))
    );
  }

  getCollaborationNetwork(): CollaborationGraph {
    // Build graph of agent relationships for visualization and planning
    const graph = new Map<string, Set<string>>();
    
    for (const agent of this.agents.values()) {
      const connections = new Set([
        ...agent.collaboration.must_consult,
        ...agent.collaboration.can_consult
      ]);
      graph.set(agent.id, connections);
    }
    
    return graph;
  }
}
```

## Dynamic Synthesis Strategies

The system automatically chooses synthesis approaches based on agent metadata:

```typescript
interface SynthesisStrategy {
  name: string;
  condition: (agents: AgentDefinition[], responses: AgentResponse[]) => boolean;
  synthesize: (responses: AgentResponse[], context: any) => Promise<SynthesizedResponse>;
}

const synthesisStrategies: SynthesisStrategy[] = [
  {
    name: "expert_override",
    condition: (agents, responses) => 
      responses.some(r => agents.find(a => a.id === r.agent_id)?.collaboration.synthesis_weight === 1.0),
    synthesize: async (responses, context) => {
      // Give full weight to agents with synthesis_weight = 1.0 (like legal)
      const expertResponses = responses.filter(r => /* high weight agents */);
      return combineExpertResponses(expertResponses);
    }
  },
  
  {
    name: "weighted_consensus",
    condition: (agents, responses) => responses.length > 2 && !hasConflicts(responses),
    synthesize: async (responses, context) => {
      // Weight responses by agent synthesis_weight
      return weightedCombination(responses, agents);
    }
  },
  
  {
    name: "conflict_resolution",
    condition: (agents, responses) => hasConflicts(responses),
    synthesize: async (responses, context) => {
      // Present options with trade-offs when agents disagree
      return presentOptions(responses, context);
    }
  }
];
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding New Agents
```typescript
// Define a new agent without changing orchestration code
const financeAgent: AgentDefinition = {
  id: "finance-agent",
  name: "Finance & Budget Advisor",
  description: "Handles budget, cost analysis, and financial decisions",
  
  capabilities: {
    domains: ["finance", "budgeting", "cost-analysis"],
    expertise: ["budget-approval", "roi-analysis", "cost-optimization"],
    keywords: ["budget", "cost", "money", "ROI", "financial"],
    confidence_threshold: 0.85
  },
  
  constraints: {
    max_response_time_ms: 7000,
    requires_human_escalation_for: ["budget-over-100k"],
    cannot_make_decisions_about: ["technical-implementation"],
    needs_collaboration_for: ["large-purchases"]
  },
  
  collaboration: {
    must_consult: [],
    can_consult: ["eng-manager", "hr-agent"],
    provides_input_to: ["eng-manager", "product-manager"],
    synthesis_weight: 0.8
  },
  
  context_needs: {
    required_data: ["department", "current_budget"],
    optional_data: ["project_timeline"],
    memory_scope: "user"
  }
};

// Register the new agent
registry.register(financeAgent, new FinanceAgentImplementation());
```

### Query Execution
```typescript
// System automatically determines which agents to use
const query = "Should we upgrade our CI/CD infrastructure to support 50+ developers?";

// The orchestrator will automatically:
// 1. Detect this needs: engineering (infrastructure), finance (cost), HR (team size)
// 2. Route to: eng-manager, finance-agent, hr-agent
// 3. Plan collaboration: eng-manager consults finance-agent for cost implications
// 4. Synthesize: weighted combination with expert input from finance on budget impact

const response = await executionEngine.executeQuery(query, userContext, registry.getAll());
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

### Complete Decoupling
- Orchestrator has zero knowledge of specific agents
- New agents plug in seamlessly
- Workflows emerge from agent capabilities
- No hardcoded business logic in orchestration layer

### Flexible Collaboration
- Agents declare their own collaboration needs
- System automatically builds collaboration chains
- Dynamic discovery of optimal agent combinations

### Metadata-Driven Intelligence
- Agent selection based on capability matching
- Automatic synthesis strategy selection
- Context-aware execution planning

### Easy Scaling
- Add new domains by adding agents
- Modify agent capabilities without code changes
- A/B test different agent configurations

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Agent logic isolated from orchestration
- Declarative agent definitions
- Easy debugging and monitoring

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Framework (2-3 weeks)
- Agent registry and definition schema
- Basic dynamic orchestrator
- Simple parallel execution
- Weighted synthesis

### Phase 2: Advanced Orchestration (3-4 weeks)
- Complex collaboration planning
- Sequential and conditional execution
- Multiple synthesis strategies
- Context management

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (4-6 weeks)
- Machine learning for agent selection optimization
- Performance analytics
- Dynamic capability adjustment
- Self-improving orchestration

This architecture gives you maximum flexibility while maintaining clean separation of concerns. The system becomes truly pluggable - you can add new agents, modify capabilities, or change collaboration patterns just by updating metadata.
