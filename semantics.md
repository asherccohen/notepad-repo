### Curriculum: Introduction to Programming Semantics with TypeScript
**Target Audience:** Junior Developers  
**Instructor Background:** Tech Lead Frontend Developer (non-CS degree, passionate about semantics)  
**Language:** TypeScript  
**Goal:** Build intuition about how programming languages work, focusing on semantics (e.g., denotational semantics), and apply it to real-world coding practices.

---

#### Week 1: What Are Semantics and Why Should We Care?
- **Objective:** Introduce the idea of semantics in a non-technical way and connect it to everyday coding.
- **Content:**
  - Define semantics simply: "Semantics is about what a piece of code *means*‚Äînot just what it does, but how we understand it."
  - Relate to natural language: Compare "The cat sleeps" (meaning) vs. "cat sleeps" (syntax) to "let x = 5" (meaning: x holds 5) vs. the syntax itself.
  - Introduce the idea that programming languages have "meanings" we can map, inspired by Aram HƒÉvƒÉrneanu‚Äôs post.
- **Activity (TypeScript Focus):**
  - Write a simple TypeScript function: `function add(a: number, b: number): number { return a + b; }`.
  - Discuss: What does this function *mean*? (It takes two numbers and returns their sum.)
  - Extend it with a type error (e.g., `add("5", 3)`), and let juniors explain the "broken meaning."
- **Takeaway:** Semantics helps us reason about code meaning, and TypeScript‚Äôs type system is a tool to enforce it.
- **Preparation for You:** Review basic TypeScript types (e.g., `number`, `string`) and how they guide meaning.

#### Week 2: Mapping Code to Meaning (Intro to Denotational Semantics)
- **Objective:** Introduce denotational semantics as "mapping code to what it does" without heavy math.
- **Content:**
  - Explain denotational semantics as assigning a "value" or "result" to every piece of code (e.g., a function maps inputs to outputs).
  - Use HƒÉvƒÉrneanu‚Äôs natural language analogy: Just as words map to ideas, code maps to actions or values.
  - Avoid domains/math; focus on intuition: "What does this code *represent*?"
- **Activity (TypeScript Focus):**
  - Define a function: `function greet(name: string): string { return `Hello, ${name}!`; }`.
  - Ask: What‚Äôs the "meaning" of `greet("Alice")`? (It represents "Hello, Alice!").
  - Create a table: Input (e.g., "Bob") ‚Üí Output (e.g., "Hello, Bob!").
  - Discuss how TypeScript ensures the "meaning" stays consistent (e.g., no numbers as names).
- **Takeaway:** Code has a "meaning map" we can predict, and types help enforce it.
- **Preparation for You:** Practice mapping simple functions to outputs; skim Wikipedia‚Äôs denotational semantics page for high-level ideas (skip the math).

---

#### Week 3: Building Blocks of Meaning with Types
- **Objective:** Explore how TypeScript types shape semantics.
- **Content:**
  - Discuss how types (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`) define what code can "mean."
  - Introduce unions and interfaces: e.g., `type Result = string | number;` or `interface User { name: string; }`.
  - Relate to semantics: Types are like rules that ensure the "meaning" aligns with intent.
- **Activity (TypeScript Focus):**
  - Create an interface: `interface Product { name: string; price: number; }`.
  - Write a function: `function describeProduct(p: Product): string { return `${p.name} costs ${p.price}`; }`.
  - Test with valid data (`{ name: "Book", price: 10 }`) and invalid data (`{ name: 5, price: "cheap" }`) to see TypeScript‚Äôs feedback.
  - Discuss: How does this enforce meaning?
- **Takeaway:** Types are a practical way to control and understand code meaning.
- **Preparation for You:** Review TypeScript documentation on interfaces and unions (keep it basic).

---

#### Week 4: From Simple to Complex Meanings
- **Objective:** Show how semantics scales with program complexity.
- **Content:**
  - Introduce nesting: Functions calling functions, or objects with nested properties.
  - Relate to denotational semantics: The "meaning" of a big program is built from smaller meanings.
- **Activity (TypeScript Focus):**
  - Build a nested structure: `interface Order { items: Product[]; total: number; }`.
  - Write: `function calculateTotal(order: Order): number { return order.items.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.price, 0); }`.
  - Trace the "meaning": Each `item.price` contributes to `total`.
  - Debug a type error (e.g., missing `price` in an item) and discuss its impact on meaning.
- **Takeaway:** Semantics composes‚Äîsmall meanings build big ones, guided by types.
- **Preparation for You:** Test the code beforehand; focus on explaining step-by-step.

---

#### Week 5: Handling Uncertainty (Optional Semantics)
- **Objective:** Introduce cases where meaning isn‚Äôt fixed (e.g., null, undefined).
- **Content:**
  - Discuss how real-world code has "uncertain meanings" (e.g., a user might not provide data).
  - Relate to denotational semantics: Sometimes the "map" includes no value (e.g., partial functions).
- **Activity (TypeScript Focus):**
  - Use optional types: `interface User { name?: string; age?: number; }`.
  - Write: `function greetUser(u: User): string { return u.name ? `Hi, ${u.name}!` : "Hi, stranger!"; }`.
  - Test with `{ name: "Alice" }` and `{}`; discuss how the meaning adapts.
- **Takeaway:** Semantics can handle flexibility with proper design.
- **Preparation for You:** Explore TypeScript‚Äôs optional chaining (`?.`) for extra depth.

---

#### Week 6: Comparing Semantics Across Languages
- **Objective:** Broaden perspective by comparing TypeScript/JavaScript with other languages.
- **Content:**
  - Briefly contrast TypeScript‚Äôs static types with JavaScript‚Äôs dynamic nature, or Python‚Äôs simplicity.
  - Relate to HƒÉvƒÉrneanu‚Äôs idea: Different languages map meanings differently.
- **Activity (TypeScript Focus):**
  - Write a TypeScript function: `function multiply(a: number, b: number): number { return a * b; }`.
  - Compare with raw JavaScript (no types) and discuss how meaning might break (e.g., `multiply("2", 3)`).
  - Optional: Show a Python equivalent for fun.
- **Takeaway:** Semantics varies by language, but TypeScript gives us control.
- **Preparation for You:** Write simple examples in JavaScript/Python; keep it light.

---

#### Week 7: Applying Semantics to Design
- **Objective:** Use semantic understanding for better code design.
- **Content:**
  - Inspired by HƒÉvƒÉrneanu‚Äôs design point, show how mapping meaning helps structure code.
  - Example: Designing a reusable component with clear "meaning."
- **Activity (TypeScript Focus):**
  - Design a `Button` component: `interface ButtonProps { label: string; onClick: () => void; }`.
  - Implement: `function Button({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) { return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>; }`.
  - Discuss: How does the interface define the button‚Äôs "meaning"?
- **Takeaway:** Semantics guides clean, predictable code.
- **Preparation for You:** Test the React-like example; ensure it works in your setup.

---

#### Week 8: Capstone Project and Reflection
- **Objective:** Apply learned concepts to a small project.
- **Content:**
  - Juniors build a mini-app (e.g., a product list with totals) using semantic principles.
  - Reflect on how types and mappings improved their understanding.
- **Activity (TypeScript Focus):**
  - Provide a starter: `interface Item { name: string; price: number; }` and a function skeleton.
  - Let them complete it, encouraging type safety and clear "meanings."
  - Group discussion: What worked? What was hard?
- **Takeaway:** Semantics is a tool for better coding and teamwork.
- **Preparation for You:** Prepare a rubric (e.g., type usage, clarity) and sample solution.
